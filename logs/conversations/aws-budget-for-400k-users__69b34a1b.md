## User

give me a budget for AWS server instance that can handle 400k users

## Assistant

A budget for 400,000 users on AWS depends on several things:

Concurrent users (not total registered users)

Type of app (API, SaaS, streaming, AI, etc.)

Architecture (single server vs autoscaling cluster)

Traffic pattern

But I can give you realistic AWS budget scenarios used by many startups.

1. Key Reality: 400k users ≠ 400k simultaneous users

Usually:

400k registered users

1–5% concurrent users

Typical peak:

4k – 20k concurrent users

This is what your infrastructure must handle.

2. Typical AWS Architecture for 400k Users

A scalable setup usually includes:

Load Balancer

Multiple EC2 instances

Auto Scaling

Database (RDS / DynamoDB)

Cache (Redis / ElastiCache)

CDN (CloudFront)

AWS recommends Auto Scaling groups to automatically add servers when traffic increases. 
AWS Documentation

3. Example Server Setup

For a typical web / SaaS app

Compute Layer

Example instance:

t3.large

2 vCPU

8GB RAM

Price:

about $0.0832 per hour (~$60/month) 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

4. Estimated Infrastructure

Example cluster:

Component	Qty	Monthly Cost
Load balancer	1	$20
EC2 instances (t3.large)	10–20	$600–$1200
Database (RDS)	1 large	$200–$600
Redis cache	1	$100
Storage + bandwidth	—	$200–$800
Total Monthly

$1,100 – $3,000 / month

5. If traffic spikes (heavy workload)

Example scaling to 40–60 servers

Service	Monthly
EC2 cluster	$2400
Database cluster	$800
CDN + bandwidth	$1000
Cache + services	$300
Total

$4,000 – $6,000 / month

6. Large-scale (high traffic apps)

If users are very active:

20k+ concurrent users

heavy APIs

media uploads

Budget:

$8k – $20k / month

7. Ways to Reduce Cost

Use Spot Instances (up to 90% cheaper) 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

Use serverless (Lambda)

Use CDN caching

Use Reserved instances

8. Real Startup Benchmark

Typical SaaS platforms with 300k–500k users spend:

$2k – $10k / month on AWS

depending on architecture.

✅ Quick estimate for your case

App type	Monthly AWS cost
Simple web / SaaS	$1k – $3k
Medium scale startup	$3k – $7k
Heavy traffic platform	$8k – $20k

💡 If you want, tell me:

Web app / mobile app / SaaS / AI

Backend language (Node, Python, Go)

Expected concurrent users

Region (US, Asia)

Then I can design a real AWS architecture for 400k users + exact monthly cost.

## User

lets say i want only 5 servers

## Assistant

If you limit your infrastructure to 5 AWS servers, we can estimate a clearer budget. I’ll assume a typical web app / API backend supporting 400k total users with moderate traffic.

Example AWS Setup (5 Servers)
Compute Instances

A common choice:

EC2 m6i.large

2 vCPU

8 GB RAM

good for production workloads

Price (approx):

$0.096/hour

~$70/month per instance (730 hrs)

For 5 servers

$70 × 5 = $350 / month
Add Other Required AWS Services

Even with only 5 servers you still need supporting services.

1️⃣ Load Balancer

Application Load Balancer

~$18–$25 / month

2️⃣ Database

Example: RDS PostgreSQL

Small production DB:

db.t3.large

~$150–$250 / month

3️⃣ Storage

EBS volumes for servers

Example:

100GB × 5 servers

~$50 / month

4️⃣ Bandwidth

Depends on traffic, but typical startup traffic:

~$100 – $400 / month

Total Estimated Monthly Cost
Service	Monthly Cost
EC2 (5 servers)	$350
Load Balancer	$20
RDS database	$200
Storage	$50
Bandwidth	$200
Estimated total

≈ $820 – $900 / month

Can 5 Servers Handle 400k Users?

Yes if traffic is moderate, for example:

5k–10k concurrent users

mostly API calls / page loads

caching enabled (Redis/CDN)

It may struggle if:

heavy AI workloads

video processing

real-time gaming

high concurrent traffic (20k+)

A Better 5-Server Architecture

Instead of 5 identical servers:

Role	Servers
API servers	3
Worker / background jobs	1
Cache / Redis	1

Plus:

Load balancer

RDS database

Expected Capacity

With good optimization:

400k registered users

5k–15k concurrent users

✅ Realistic monthly AWS budget with 5 servers

$800 – $1,200 / month

## User

for a 1,800usd budget a year, can we have something to handle 400k users?

## Assistant

Yes, but only in a very narrow sense.

If “400k users” means 400,000 registered accounts and only a small fraction are active at once, then $1,800/year ($150/month) can work on AWS with a very lean setup. If you mean heavy daily usage or thousands of concurrent users, then no, $1,800/year is not realistic on AWS. Your monthly budget is only $150/month. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

With current EC2 on-demand pricing, a t4g.medium is listed at $0.0336/hour on AWS’s pricing page. Running 5 of them 24/7 would cost about $122.64/month and $1,471.68/year for compute alone, before load balancing, database, storage, and bandwidth. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

That means your earlier “5 servers” idea would leave only about $27/month for everything else. AWS charges separately for services like Application Load Balancer and RDS, and CloudFront/CDN and storage also add cost. ALB pricing includes both running hours and LCU usage, and RDS is billed separately by DB instance/storage/usage. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

Amazon Web Services, Inc.

So the practical answer is:

No, not for a normal multi-server app with database and load balancer.
Maybe, if you build for very low cost per request.

A realistic low-budget AWS design for 400k registered users would look more like this:

1–2 small app servers or a mostly serverless backend

CloudFront in front so most traffic never hits your origin

S3 for static assets

a small database or DynamoDB-style usage pattern

aggressive caching

minimal background jobs

very small media footprint

At your budget, I would target something like:

Compute: $25–$70/month

Database: $20–$50/month

Storage + backups: $10–$20/month

CDN / bandwidth / misc: $20–$50/month
That keeps you roughly in the $75–$190/month zone, so it is possible only if traffic is light and the app is optimized. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

Here is the blunt rule of thumb:

400k registered users, low concurrency: possible

400k users with frequent logins and API activity: unlikely

5 always-on servers: not a good fit for this budget

serverless + CDN + cache-heavy app: best chance of fitting budget

If you want, I can sketch a $150/month AWS architecture for your exact app type and estimate how many daily active users / concurrent users it could realistically support.

## User

yes please do

## Assistant

Yes — if 400k means total accounts, not 400k people online at once.

With $1,800/year = $150/month, I would not build this as “5 always-on servers.” I’d build it as a lean edge-heavy architecture so most traffic is absorbed by CDN/cache and only a small amount hits your backend. AWS now has a CloudFront Pro flat-rate plan at $15/month that includes CDN, WAF, DDoS protection, Route 53 DNS, logging, serverless edge compute, and 50 TB data transfer / 10M requests in the plan; AWS also says traffic from CloudFront to AWS origins is waived, which helps keep origin costs down. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

Here is the best-fit AWS architecture at about $150/month:

CloudFront Pro in front of everything: $15/month

S3 for images, JS, CSS, downloadable files: usually $2–$8/month for a small app because S3 is pay-as-you-go with no minimum charge 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

1 EC2 app server on t4g.medium for your API/app: $24.53/month at the listed on-demand rate of $0.0336/hour 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

1 small EC2 worker / cron / queue processor on t4g.small: $12.26/month at $0.0168/hour 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

EBS gp3 storage for the EC2 instances: budget about $8–$15/month; gp3 is AWS’s lower-cost general-purpose SSD tier and AWS states it provides up to 20% lower price per GB than gp2 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

DynamoDB on-demand for user/session/metadata traffic: budget $20–$50/month to start; on-demand mode is pay-per-request and automatically scales with traffic, which is exactly what you want when your traffic is bursty but your budget is tight 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+2
AWS Documentation
+2

Lambda for burst work like email/webhooks/image processing/background jobs: budget $5–$20/month; Lambda is pay-per-use and AWS bills by requests and duration rather than keeping servers running 24/7 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

Monitoring, backups, misc: keep $10–$20/month reserved

That puts your realistic monthly total around:

Low usage: $85–$110/month

Healthy small product: $110–$145/month

Busy month: $145–$180/month if DynamoDB/Lambda usage spikes 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+4
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

So my recommendation is this exact budget split:

CloudFront Pro: $15

EC2 app server: $24.53

EC2 worker: $12.26

EBS: $10

S3: $5

DynamoDB: $35

Lambda: $10

Backups/monitoring/misc: $18–$25

Target total: about $130–$137/month, leaving a small buffer under your $150/month cap. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

What this can realistically handle:

400k registered users: yes

Daily active users in the low thousands: yes, if most content is cached and your API is lightweight

Concurrent users in the low hundreds, maybe higher in short bursts: plausible with CloudFront, S3, DynamoDB, and Lambda absorbing traffic

Thousands of concurrent users hitting uncached dynamic endpoints all at once: not reliably on this budget 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+2
AWS Documentation
+2

What you should avoid at this budget:

RDS as your main database unless usage is tiny

Application Load Balancer unless you truly need it

5 always-on EC2 servers

storing user uploads directly on app servers

chat, video, live streaming, or heavy AI inference on the same budget

The cheapest pattern is:

serve everything static from S3 + CloudFront

keep the main app on one small Graviton EC2

push spiky work to Lambda

store scalable app data in DynamoDB on-demand

cache aggressively so the app server does as little work as possible 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+2
AWS Documentation
+2

A blunt conclusion: yes, $1,800/year can support a product with 400k users on AWS, but only if the product is lightweight, cache-heavy, and designed for low origin load. It is not enough for a conventional “many servers + managed SQL + heavy API traffic” setup.

## User

so what would be the cheapest setup budget i need for 400k users per month including S3 storage and RDS?

## Assistant

For a cheap AWS setup that still includes EC2 + S3 + RDS, I would budget about $80–$120/month minimum, and I would treat $100–$150/month as the safer floor. That is for 400k total accounts, not 400k concurrent users. With RDS in the mix, the database becomes the main fixed cost. AWS bills RDS separately for DB instance hours, storage, backup storage, and any extra usage, so the DB is usually what sets the floor. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

The cheapest viable setup I’d use looks like this:

1 EC2 app server: t4g.small
AWS lists t4g.small at $0.0168/hour, which is about $12.26/month if it runs all month. t4g.medium is $0.0336/hour, about $24.53/month. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

EBS for that EC2 server: use gp3, not gp2
AWS’s EBS pricing example uses $0.08 per GB-month for gp3 in a region example, so 30 GB is roughly $2.40/month and 50 GB is about $4/month before snapshots. gp3 also includes baseline performance and is priced lower than gp2. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

1 small RDS Single-AZ database
AWS says RDS pricing is pay-as-you-go and the PostgreSQL pricing page points to the calculator for an estimate. RDS also includes automated backups, and backup storage up to 100% of provisioned storage is generally included before overage. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

S3 for files/uploads/assets
S3 Standard storage is $0.023/GB-month for the first 50 TB. That means 100 GB is about $2.30/month, 500 GB is about $11.50/month, and 1 TB is about $23/month, before request charges. AWS also charges for S3 requests like PUT, GET, and LIST. 
AWS Documentation
+1

No load balancer at first
ALB adds hourly and LCU charges, so it is not part of the cheapest setup. AWS explicitly bills ALB for both running hours and Load Balancer Capacity Units. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

So the practical budget floor is roughly:

EC2 + EBS: about $15–$30/month depending on t4g.small vs t4g.medium and disk size. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

S3: about $2–$25/month depending on whether you store 100 GB to 1 TB. 
AWS Documentation
+1

RDS: this is the wildcard, but it is the part that usually pushes the total into the $80+ per month range because it has a compute charge plus storage/backups. AWS’s public pricing pages confirm that structure even when the exact smallest-instance hourly rate isn’t surfaced in the snippet here. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

My blunt recommendation:

Cheapest viable monthly budget with S3 + RDS: $100/month
Safer minimum: $120–$150/month

That gets you a setup like:

1 small EC2 app server

1 small Single-AZ RDS instance

100–500 GB on S3

no ALB

low to moderate traffic

mostly cached/static content

What it can handle:

400k registered users: yes, potentially

400k active users per month: maybe, if usage is light

thousands of users hammering dynamic endpoints at once: no, not on the cheapest setup

Also keep in mind AWS gives 100 GB/month of free data transfer out across services, which helps at the low end, but past that your bandwidth costs rise. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

A good rule is:

Absolute floor: around $80–$120/month

Realistic cheap production floor: around $120–$200/month

If you want, I can turn this into a line-by-line cheapest AWS stack with exact assumptions like 100 GB S3, PostgreSQL, 1 app server, and expected monthly active users.

## User

can you give be a complete list in a table of the basic needs for the app to run, example is EC2, RDS, Load balancer, etc. just the basics needs to run and become operational and ready for auto scaling for a movie streaming app

## Assistant

Yes — for a movie streaming app, the “basic operational stack” is a bit more than a normal web app because you need both app infrastructure and a video delivery pipeline.

Here’s a practical basic AWS stack that can go live and be ready for auto scaling.

Layer	AWS service	Need level	What it does	Why it matters for a movie streaming app
DNS / domain	Route 53	Required	Points your domain to your app/CDN	Lets users reach yourapp.com, and AWS has guidance for routing Route 53 traffic to CloudFront. 
AWS Documentation

SSL certificate	AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)	Required	HTTPS/TLS certificates	Needed so login, payments, and video delivery run over HTTPS.
Network	Amazon VPC	Required	Your isolated AWS network	Standard base for subnets, routing, security groups, and multi-AZ layout. AWS describes VPC as a logically isolated virtual network. 
AWS Documentation

Network security	Security Groups	Required	Firewall rules for EC2, ALB, RDS	Controls who can reach your app servers and database.
Compute	EC2	Required	Runs your web app, API, admin panel, background services	Your backend, auth, billing, recommendation logic, admin CMS, etc.
Scaling config	Launch Template	Required	Blueprint for EC2 instances	Needed so Auto Scaling can launch identical new app servers. 
AWS Documentation

Traffic entry point	Application Load Balancer (ALB)	Required	Distributes traffic across app servers	AWS recommends ALB for load-balanced Auto Scaling setups, and it works directly with Auto Scaling groups. 
AWS Documentation
+1

Server auto scaling	EC2 Auto Scaling Group	Required	Adds/removes EC2 instances automatically	Core service for scaling app servers based on demand and health checks. AWS says EC2 Auto Scaling launches/terminates instances automatically using scaling policies and health checks. 
AWS Documentation
+1

Relational database	Amazon RDS	Required	Stores users, subscriptions, watch history, catalog metadata, payments metadata	Best fit for transactional app data. For production, high availability usually means Multi-AZ. AWS says Multi-AZ RDS can place writer/reader instances across separate Availability Zones. 
AWS Documentation

Object storage	Amazon S3	Required	Stores videos, thumbnails, subtitles, posters, logs, uploads	Core storage layer for media assets; AWS describes S3 as object storage for storing and retrieving any amount of data. 
AWS Documentation
+1

CDN	Amazon CloudFront	Required	Caches and delivers content close to viewers	Essential for streaming performance and lowering origin load. AWS says CloudFront caching serves objects from edge locations closer to users and reduces origin load and latency. 
AWS Documentation

Video processing	AWS Elemental MediaConvert	Required for VOD	Transcodes uploaded movies into streaming-friendly formats and bitrates	For a Netflix-style app, uploaded source files must be converted into ABR outputs for different devices and network speeds. AWS says MediaConvert is a file-based video processing service for scalable video transcoding and ABR outputs. 
AWS Documentation
+1

Monitoring	Amazon CloudWatch	Required	Metrics, logs, alarms	Needed to watch CPU, memory, errors, latency, scaling events, and failures. AWS describes CloudWatch as a reliable, scalable monitoring solution. 
AWS Documentation

Access control	IAM	Required	Permissions for people and services	Controls what your app servers, developers, and CI/CD can access. AWS documents IAM-based access management across services like VPC. 
AWS Documentation

Web app protection	AWS WAF	Strongly recommended	Filters malicious web requests	Helps protect ALB/CloudFront against bad traffic, bot abuse, and common web attacks. AWS says WAF can protect CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. 
AWS Documentation
+1

DDoS baseline	AWS Shield Standard	Included / recommended	Basic DDoS protection	Useful for public streaming apps exposed on the internet. AWS groups Shield with WAF as the DDoS/web protection stack. 
AWS Documentation
Minimum production architecture

If you want the smallest serious setup, it would usually be:

Route 53

ACM

VPC with public and private subnets across at least 2 Availability Zones

ALB

EC2 Auto Scaling Group

RDS

S3

CloudFront

MediaConvert

CloudWatch

IAM

WAF

That is the core stack that makes the app operational, scalable, and production-ready for a VOD movie platform. AWS’s own Auto Scaling guidance ties together launch template + ALB + Auto Scaling group, while CloudFront reduces origin load and MediaConvert prepares the video files for streaming delivery. 
AWS Documentation

What each part serves in plain English
Function in your app	Service
Website / API / login / subscription logic	EC2
Adds more app servers when traffic rises	Auto Scaling Group
Sends traffic to healthy app servers	ALB
Stores user data and catalog data	RDS
Stores movie files and images	S3
Delivers movies fast worldwide	CloudFront
Converts uploaded masters into streaming renditions	MediaConvert
Provides domain and routing	Route 53
Secures HTTPS	ACM
Monitors uptime and load	CloudWatch
Controls permissions	IAM
Blocks malicious traffic	WAF
A few things that are not strictly “basic,” but you will likely want soon
Service	Why you may add it
ElastiCache / Redis	Faster sessions, caching, rate limiting, homepage/catalog speed
SQS	Decouple background jobs like email, notifications, ingestion
AWS Secrets Manager	Safer DB/API secret storage
CloudFront signed URLs/cookies	Restrict who can watch paid/protected videos
AWS KMS	Encryption key management
DRM / advanced packaging stack	Needed if studios/licensing require stronger content protection
Best “basic” launch recommendation

For a first real launch, I’d suggest this layout:

2 EC2 app instances minimum

1 ALB

1 Auto Scaling Group

1 RDS database

1 S3 bucket for media

1 CloudFront distribution

MediaConvert for ingestion/transcoding

WAF on CloudFront

CloudWatch alarms

That gives you a setup that is not just running, but also ready to scale horizontally when usage grows. AWS specifically notes that ALB and Auto Scaling integrate so instances launched by the Auto Scaling group are automatically registered and deregistered with the load balancer. 
AWS Documentation

I can also turn this into a cheapest possible AWS architecture table with estimated monthly costs for a streaming app.

## User

yes please do that and lets say i want this setup can accommodate up to 400k users non concurrent

## Assistant

Below is a realistic low-cost AWS production architecture for a movie streaming app that can support ~400k registered users (non-concurrent).
This assumes:

Only a small fraction are active at once (ex: 200–1,000 concurrent users)

Videos are delivered mostly via CDN (CloudFront) instead of your servers

Movies stored in S3

Backend handles auth, metadata, subscriptions, etc.

Target budget: ~$120–$200/month

Cheapest Practical AWS Architecture (Streaming App)
Layer	AWS Service	Example configuration	Est. monthly cost	Purpose
DNS	Route53	Hosted zone	$1–$2	Domain routing
SSL	ACM	Free certificate	$0	HTTPS
Network	VPC	default VPC	$0	Isolated network
Load balancing	Application Load Balancer	1 ALB	$18–$25	Distribute traffic
App compute	EC2	2 × t4g.small	$25	Backend API
Auto scaling	Auto Scaling Group	2–5 servers	$0	Automatic scaling
Database	RDS PostgreSQL	db.t4g.micro or small	$15–$35	Users, subscriptions
Object storage	S3	1–2 TB video storage	$23–$46	Movie files
CDN	CloudFront	video delivery	$20–$60	Streaming performance
Video transcoding	MediaConvert	pay per job	$10–$30	Convert uploads
Logging	CloudWatch	logs + metrics	$5–$10	Monitoring
Security	AWS WAF	basic rules	$5–$10	Protect app
Estimated Total Monthly Cost
Scenario	Monthly
Very light traffic	$110 – $130
Normal early platform	$130 – $170
Busy month	$170 – $220
Why This Can Handle 400k Users

Because registered users ≠ active users.

Example platform metrics:

Metric	Typical ratio
Registered users	400,000
Monthly active users	40k–80k
Daily active users	5k–10k
Concurrent viewers	200–800

The CDN handles most traffic, not your servers.

Flow:

User
  ↓
CloudFront CDN
  ↓
S3 (video storage)

Your backend only handles:

login

subscription

recommendations

metadata

analytics

How Streaming Actually Works

Video delivery path:

User
 ↓
CloudFront CDN
 ↓
S3 bucket

App backend path:

User
 ↓
Load Balancer
 ↓
EC2 servers
 ↓
RDS database

This architecture keeps the expensive compute layer very small.

Auto Scaling Setup
Component	Scaling
EC2	2 → 5 instances
CloudFront	unlimited
S3	unlimited
RDS	vertical scaling

Scaling triggers:

CPU > 70%

request count

network throughput

Expected Capacity

This architecture can realistically support:

Metric	Capacity
Registered users	~400k
Concurrent viewers	~500–1000
Video storage	several TB
Monthly streaming traffic	several TB

Because CloudFront and S3 scale automatically.

Cost Driver (Important)

For streaming apps the biggest cost is bandwidth, not servers.

Example:

Streaming traffic	Cost
2 TB	~$40
10 TB	~$200
50 TB	~$800

Servers remain cheap.

Cheapest Optimizations

To keep the platform under $150/month early:

1️⃣ Use Graviton instances (t4g)
2️⃣ Store videos in S3 + CloudFront only
3️⃣ Avoid large RDS until needed
4️⃣ Cache aggressively in CDN
5️⃣ Keep 2 backend servers

Final Recommended Cheapest Setup
Service	Setup
EC2	2 × t4g.small
ALB	1
RDS	db.t4g.micro
S3	movie storage
CloudFront	CDN streaming
MediaConvert	transcoding
Auto Scaling	2–5 instances

Monthly estimate:

👉 $130–$180

✅ This is the lowest realistic AWS production budget for a movie streaming platform that can support ~400k registered users.

## User

can you make it a little bit higher like a medium size server, with auto scaling for 2-5 server that's correct you suggested. but the server will serve movie streaming and social media app

## Assistant

Yes. For a movie streaming + social media app, I’d move your app tier to 2–5 EC2 t4g.medium instances behind an Application Load Balancer, with RDS, S3, CloudFront, and a small Redis/ElastiCache layer. t4g.medium is a sensible “medium” starting point for general-purpose app servers, and EC2 Auto Scaling itself has no extra service fee beyond the EC2 and CloudWatch resources you use.

I’m using US East (N. Virginia) style public pricing as a planning baseline. Actual cost will vary by region, storage size, request volume, and especially video bandwidth, which is the biggest wildcard for a streaming product. AWS’s pricing pages are pay-as-you-go and region-dependent.

Recommended baseline stack
Component	Recommended setup	Why it’s needed	Est. monthly
EC2 app tier	2–5 × t4g.medium	API, auth, social feed, comments, admin, playback/session logic	$49.06–$122.64
Auto Scaling Group	1 group, min 2 / desired 2 / max 5	Scales app servers automatically	$0
Application Load Balancer	1 ALB	Distributes traffic to healthy app servers	~$20–$35
RDS PostgreSQL	db.t4g.medium to start	Users, subscriptions, posts, comments, metadata	~$47.45 + storage/backups
RDS storage	100–200 GB	Database storage	~$10–$25
ElastiCache / Redis	small starter node or serverless budget	Feed/session/cache/rate-limit hot data	~$15–$40
S3 Standard	1 TB starter media/storage	Videos, thumbnails, images, static files	~$23 per TB stored
CloudFront	1 distribution	Delivers video/images globally, reduces origin load	usage-based
EBS for EC2	100 GB per app server	App disk/logs	~$8 per 100 GB per server
CloudWatch	logs + alarms	Monitoring and autoscaling signals	~$5–$15
ACM	1 certificate	HTTPS	$0
Route 53	hosted zone + DNS queries	Domain routing	~$1–$3
WAF	basic managed rules	Public-app protection	~$5–$20

The EC2 math above comes from the public t4g.medium on-demand hourly price of $0.0336/hour, which works out to $24.53/month each, $49.06/month for 2, and $122.64/month for 5 at 730 hours. For RDS, a current public instance listing shows db.t4g.medium starting at $0.065/hour, or about $47.45/month, while AWS’s official RDS pricing page confirms storage, backups, and usage are billed separately and that T classes can also incur CPU credit charges above baseline.

What I would actually deploy

For your case, I’d use this as the smallest medium-size production shape:

Layer	My pick
App servers	2 × t4g.medium at launch, autoscale to 5
Database	RDS PostgreSQL db.t4g.medium
Cache	Small Redis
Object storage	S3
Video delivery	CloudFront
Load balancing	1 ALB
Scaling	ASG min 2 / max 5
Monitoring	CloudWatch + alarms
Security	ACM + WAF + security groups

That setup is enough for 400k registered users as long as they are not concurrent, because the heavy video delivery should come from CloudFront + S3, not from your EC2 instances. CloudFront is built to reduce origin load and cache content at the edge, while S3 is pay-as-you-go object storage with no minimum charge.

Estimated monthly budget
1) Core infrastructure, excluding heavy streaming bandwidth

This is the part you can budget as your “base burn.”

Scenario	Estimated monthly
Lean launch: 2 app servers running most of the time	~$175–$260
Normal month: mix of 2–3 app servers	~$210–$320
Busy month: app tier often at 5 servers	~$290–$430

That estimate assumes:

EC2 app tier: $49–$123

ALB: ~$20–$35

RDS + storage: ~$60–$90

Redis/cache: ~$15–$40

EBS: ~$16–$40

S3 stored media: ~$23 per TB

CloudWatch / Route 53 / WAF / misc: ~$15–$45

2) Streaming bandwidth

This is the part that can blow up your bill.

For a streaming app, data transfer and CDN usage often matter more than server count. AWS’s CloudFront pricing is usage-based, and S3 also charges for requests and data-related operations on top of storage.

A practical way to think about it:

If your catalog is small and viewing hours are still low, you may stay close to the core infrastructure budget above.

Once viewing hours rise, CloudFront transfer can become your largest line item very quickly. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

Best answer in one line

For a medium-size 2–5 server setup that supports a movie streaming + social media app and is ready for autoscaling, I’d budget:

about $200–$350/month base infrastructure, plus streaming bandwidth on top.
A safer all-in planning number for early production is $300–$600/month, because video delivery can overtake compute costs fast.

My final recommended starter config
Service	Starter choice
EC2	2 × t4g.medium, autoscale to 5
RDS	PostgreSQL db.t4g.medium
Redis	small starter tier
ALB	1
S3	1–2 TB to start
CloudFront	1 distribution
WAF	basic managed rules
CloudWatch	logs, CPU, latency, 5xx alarms

That is the cheapest version I’d call realistically usable for your use case without undersizing the app tier.

## User

make this canva ready presentation

## Assistant

I created a Canva-ready PowerPoint presentation for you.

You can download it here and upload it directly to Canva:

aws_streaming_app_architecture.pptx

Canva supports importing .pptx, so once uploaded you can:

change fonts and colors

add icons and diagrams

apply Canva templates

export as pitch deck / PDF

The slides include:

Architecture overview

EC2 autoscaling (2–5 servers)

RDS database layer

S3 + CloudFront streaming pipeline

Redis caching

Security stack

Monitoring

Estimated monthly infrastructure cost

Scaling path for growth

If you'd like, I can also create a much more polished investor-style deck (with diagrams, architecture visuals, and icons) that looks closer to a startup pitch or tech architecture presentation.

## User

i dont need to much of explanation..just provide a clear table of all the features needed to run the app i told you for 400k users non concurrent. make a budget for every feature per month basis

## Assistant

Below is a clean, budget-focused table of the core AWS services needed to run a movie streaming + social media app that can support ~400k registered users (non-concurrent) with 2–5 medium servers autoscaling.

Assumptions:

Region similar to US-East

2 EC2 servers running normally, scaling up to 5 during spikes

1–2 TB media storage

Moderate traffic

Prices are monthly estimates

Compute (EC2) is not the main cost in streaming platforms.

If you'd like, I can also make a second table showing the cheapest possible setup (~$120-$180/month) and a large-scale setup for 1M users, so you can see how the architecture evolves.

## User

my client cant understand what it means for just a server and what we need is a whole package to run and manager services and not only server, can you give me a presentation or 1 image to understand that?

## User

make a comparison of just a server monolothic server setup comparing to that what you built in images

## User

from this "Below is a clean, budget-focused table of the core AWS services needed to run a movie streaming + social media app that can support ~400k registered users (non-concurrent) with 2–5 medium servers autoscaling." you response, can make this in a table, landscape view to better see it?

## Assistant

Here is the same infrastructure plan arranged in a wide landscape-style table so it is easier to present to a client (good for slides or documents).
It clearly shows the full package needed to run the platform, not just servers.

Key Message for Clients

This is not just a server.

A production platform requires a full cloud infrastructure stack:

Servers + Database + Storage + CDN + Cache + Security + Monitoring

That combination is what allows the platform to support hundreds of thousands of users reliably.

If you'd like, I can also make a very clean visual architecture diagram (client-friendly) that looks like something used in startup investor decks or AWS architecture diagrams. It will be much easier for non-technical clients to understand.

## User

ok sure please do that but include this table budget matrix you made to the presentation. also highlight the EC2 row data just to emphasize that its what they are referring about servers that its just part of the Full Stack

## Assistant

I’ll recreate the presentation for you with the following structure so it’s client-friendly and visually clear:

Slides included:

1️⃣ Title Slide

Streaming + Social Media App Infrastructure

Capacity: ~400k users (non-concurrent)

Autoscaling 2–5 servers

2️⃣ Architecture Diagram (simple visual flow)

This slide shows that servers are only one component.

3️⃣ Infrastructure Budget Matrix (Landscape Table)
(EC2 row highlighted to emphasize what people mean by “servers”)

Infrastructure Layer	AWS Service	Configuration	Monthly Budget	Role
DNS / Domain	Route53	Hosted zone + queries	$1 – $3	Domain routing
Security	ACM	TLS certificate	$0	HTTPS encryption
Networking	VPC	Default VPC	$0	Network isolation
Traffic Distribution	Application Load Balancer	1 ALB	$20 – $35	Distribute traffic
⭐ Compute (SERVERS)	⭐ EC2	⭐ t4g.medium × 2–5	⭐ $49 – $123	⭐ Runs backend application
Autoscaling	Auto Scaling Group	2–5 instances	$0	Automatic scaling
Server Storage	EBS	100GB per server	$16 – $40	Instance disk
Database	RDS PostgreSQL	db.t4g.medium	$60 – $90	User data
Cache	ElastiCache Redis	small instance	$15 – $40	Feed/session caching
Media Storage	S3	1–2 TB	$23 – $46	Movies & media
CDN Streaming	CloudFront	1 distribution	$20 – $80	Video delivery
Monitoring	CloudWatch	metrics + logs	$5 – $15	Monitoring
Security	AWS WAF	managed rules	$5 – $20	Attack protection

4️⃣ Client Takeaway Slide

What people call “a server” is only this:

EC2 App Servers

But the real production platform is:

Servers
+ Database
+ Storage
+ CDN
+ Load Balancer
+ Cache
+ Security
+ Monitoring

That full stack is what makes the platform capable of supporting hundreds of thousands of users.

✅ If you'd like, I can also make a very polished visual diagram (like Netflix/AWS architecture diagrams) that looks much more professional for clients or investors and clearly shows:

Users → CDN → Load Balancer → Autoscaling Servers → Database + Storage

It will be much easier for non-technical clients to understand.

## User

yes please but still include the budget matrix table and make Grand Total at the bottom of the table more or less also
make the 2️⃣ Architecture Diagram (simple visual flow) in an image to be more visually presentable

## Assistant

I created the presentation with:

Architecture diagram (visual flow)

Budget matrix table

EC2 row highlighted to show what people mean by “servers”

Grand Total row at the bottom

Client explanation slide

You can download it here:

aws_streaming_full_stack_client_presentation.pptx

You can upload this directly to Canva, PowerPoint, or Google Slides.

What the slides include:

Title slide

Visual architecture diagram

Landscape budget matrix table with EC2 highlighted

Grand Total monthly estimate

Client explanation: why a server is only one component of the stack

If you want, I can also make a much more polished architecture image (AWS-style diagram like Netflix/Uber presentations) that will look much clearer and more impressive for clients or investors.

## User

yes please i like that but avoid the powerpoint presentation i dont like the result, if you can generate images for the visual reprentations, its much better but for table just do it here so ican copy and paste it

## User

Starting on this response you made "I’ll recreate the presentation for you with the following structure so it’s client-friendly and visually clear:" please have a grand total for the more or less subtotal with a more or less grand total too, also include the monolithic vs Full Stack and this Streaming & Social Media App Full Stack Architecture presenstation

## Assistant

Great — I’ll structure it exactly like a client-ready explanation, but with visual sections + copy-paste tables and include:

1️⃣ Monolithic vs Full Stack comparison
2️⃣ Streaming & Social Media Full Stack Architecture
3️⃣ Budget Matrix Table
4️⃣ Subtotal + Grand Total estimates

You can copy this directly into a proposal, document, or Canva slide.

7️⃣ Simple Client Explanation

When someone says:

“We only need a server.”

They are referring to this row only:

EC2 Servers

But a real production platform requires:

Servers
+ Database
+ Storage
+ CDN
+ Load Balancer
+ Cache
+ Security
+ Monitoring

That full stack is what allows the platform to handle hundreds of thousands of users safely.

✅ If you'd like, I can also generate one extremely clean architecture image (Netflix-style diagram) that visually shows:

Monolithic vs Full Cloud Stack

This will make the difference immediately obvious to non-technical clients.

## User

this not i want, the monolithic vs Full Stack im referring is the one you sent me with just an image
