## User

give me a budget for AWS server instance that can handle 400k users

## Assistant

A budget for 400,000 users on AWS depends on several things:

Concurrent users (not total registered users)

Type of app (API, SaaS, streaming, AI, etc.)

Architecture (single server vs autoscaling cluster)

Traffic pattern

But I can give you realistic AWS budget scenarios used by many startups.

1. Key Reality: 400k users ≠ 400k simultaneous users

Usually:

400k registered users

1–5% concurrent users

Typical peak:

4k – 20k concurrent users

This is what your infrastructure must handle.

2. Typical AWS Architecture for 400k Users

A scalable setup usually includes:

Load Balancer

Multiple EC2 instances

Auto Scaling

Database (RDS / DynamoDB)

Cache (Redis / ElastiCache)

CDN (CloudFront)

AWS recommends Auto Scaling groups to automatically add servers when traffic increases. 
AWS Documentation

3. Example Server Setup

For a typical web / SaaS app

Compute Layer

Example instance:

t3.large

2 vCPU

8GB RAM

Price:

about $0.0832 per hour (~$60/month) 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

4. Estimated Infrastructure

Example cluster:

Component	Qty	Monthly Cost
Load balancer	1	$20
EC2 instances (t3.large)	10–20	$600–$1200
Database (RDS)	1 large	$200–$600
Redis cache	1	$100
Storage + bandwidth	—	$200–$800
Total Monthly

$1,100 – $3,000 / month

5. If traffic spikes (heavy workload)

Example scaling to 40–60 servers

Service	Monthly
EC2 cluster	$2400
Database cluster	$800
CDN + bandwidth	$1000
Cache + services	$300
Total

$4,000 – $6,000 / month

6. Large-scale (high traffic apps)

If users are very active:

20k+ concurrent users

heavy APIs

media uploads

Budget:

$8k – $20k / month

7. Ways to Reduce Cost

Use Spot Instances (up to 90% cheaper) 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

Use serverless (Lambda)

Use CDN caching

Use Reserved instances

8. Real Startup Benchmark

Typical SaaS platforms with 300k–500k users spend:

$2k – $10k / month on AWS

depending on architecture.

✅ Quick estimate for your case

App type	Monthly AWS cost
Simple web / SaaS	$1k – $3k
Medium scale startup	$3k – $7k
Heavy traffic platform	$8k – $20k

💡 If you want, tell me:

Web app / mobile app / SaaS / AI

Backend language (Node, Python, Go)

Expected concurrent users

Region (US, Asia)

Then I can design a real AWS architecture for 400k users + exact monthly cost.

## User

lets say i want only 5 servers

## Assistant

If you limit your infrastructure to 5 AWS servers, we can estimate a clearer budget. I’ll assume a typical web app / API backend supporting 400k total users with moderate traffic.

Example AWS Setup (5 Servers)
Compute Instances

A common choice:

EC2 m6i.large

2 vCPU

8 GB RAM

good for production workloads

Price (approx):

$0.096/hour

~$70/month per instance (730 hrs)

For 5 servers

$70 × 5 = $350 / month
Add Other Required AWS Services

Even with only 5 servers you still need supporting services.

1️⃣ Load Balancer

Application Load Balancer

~$18–$25 / month

2️⃣ Database

Example: RDS PostgreSQL

Small production DB:

db.t3.large

~$150–$250 / month

3️⃣ Storage

EBS volumes for servers

Example:

100GB × 5 servers

~$50 / month

4️⃣ Bandwidth

Depends on traffic, but typical startup traffic:

~$100 – $400 / month

Total Estimated Monthly Cost
Service	Monthly Cost
EC2 (5 servers)	$350
Load Balancer	$20
RDS database	$200
Storage	$50
Bandwidth	$200
Estimated total

≈ $820 – $900 / month

Can 5 Servers Handle 400k Users?

Yes if traffic is moderate, for example:

5k–10k concurrent users

mostly API calls / page loads

caching enabled (Redis/CDN)

It may struggle if:

heavy AI workloads

video processing

real-time gaming

high concurrent traffic (20k+)

A Better 5-Server Architecture

Instead of 5 identical servers:

Role	Servers
API servers	3
Worker / background jobs	1
Cache / Redis	1

Plus:

Load balancer

RDS database

Expected Capacity

With good optimization:

400k registered users

5k–15k concurrent users

✅ Realistic monthly AWS budget with 5 servers

$800 – $1,200 / month

## User

for a 1,800usd budget a year, can we have something to handle 400k users?

## Assistant

Yes, but only in a very narrow sense.

If “400k users” means 400,000 registered accounts and only a small fraction are active at once, then $1,800/year ($150/month) can work on AWS with a very lean setup. If you mean heavy daily usage or thousands of concurrent users, then no, $1,800/year is not realistic on AWS. Your monthly budget is only $150/month. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

With current EC2 on-demand pricing, a t4g.medium is listed at $0.0336/hour on AWS’s pricing page. Running 5 of them 24/7 would cost about $122.64/month and $1,471.68/year for compute alone, before load balancing, database, storage, and bandwidth. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

That means your earlier “5 servers” idea would leave only about $27/month for everything else. AWS charges separately for services like Application Load Balancer and RDS, and CloudFront/CDN and storage also add cost. ALB pricing includes both running hours and LCU usage, and RDS is billed separately by DB instance/storage/usage. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

So the practical answer is:

No, not for a normal multi-server app with database and load balancer.
Maybe, if you build for very low cost per request.

A realistic low-budget AWS design for 400k registered users would look more like this:

1–2 small app servers or a mostly serverless backend

CloudFront in front so most traffic never hits your origin

S3 for static assets

a small database or DynamoDB-style usage pattern

aggressive caching

minimal background jobs

very small media footprint

At your budget, I would target something like:

Compute: $25–$70/month

Database: $20–$50/month

Storage + backups: $10–$20/month

CDN / bandwidth / misc: $20–$50/month
That keeps you roughly in the $75–$190/month zone, so it is possible only if traffic is light and the app is optimized.

Here is the blunt rule of thumb:

400k registered users, low concurrency: possible

400k users with frequent logins and API activity: unlikely

5 always-on servers: not a good fit for this budget

serverless + CDN + cache-heavy app: best chance of fitting budget

If you want, I can sketch a $150/month AWS architecture for your exact app type and estimate how many daily active users / concurrent users it could realistically support.

## User

yes please do

## Assistant

Yes — if 400k means total accounts, not 400k people online at once.

With $1,800/year = $150/month, I would not build this as “5 always-on servers.” I’d build it as a lean edge-heavy architecture so most traffic is absorbed by CDN/cache and only a small amount hits your backend. AWS now has a CloudFront Pro flat-rate plan at $15/month that includes CDN, WAF, DDoS protection, Route 53 DNS, logging, serverless edge compute, and 50 TB data transfer / 10M requests in the plan; AWS also says traffic from CloudFront to AWS origins is waived, which helps keep origin costs down. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

Here is the best-fit AWS architecture at about $150/month:

CloudFront Pro in front of everything: $15/month

S3 for images, JS, CSS, downloadable files: usually $2–$8/month for a small app because S3 is pay-as-you-go with no minimum charge 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

1 EC2 app server on t4g.medium for your API/app: $24.53/month at the listed on-demand rate of $0.0336/hour 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

1 small EC2 worker / cron / queue processor on t4g.small: $12.26/month at $0.0168/hour 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

EBS gp3 storage for the EC2 instances: budget about $8–$15/month; gp3 is AWS’s lower-cost general-purpose SSD tier and AWS states it provides up to 20% lower price per GB than gp2 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

DynamoDB on-demand for user/session/metadata traffic: budget $20–$50/month to start; on-demand mode is pay-per-request and automatically scales with traffic, which is exactly what you want when your traffic is bursty but your budget is tight 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+2
AWS Documentation
+2

Lambda for burst work like email/webhooks/image processing/background jobs: budget $5–$20/month; Lambda is pay-per-use and AWS bills by requests and duration rather than keeping servers running 24/7 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

Monitoring, backups, misc: keep $10–$20/month reserved

That puts your realistic monthly total around:

Low usage: $85–$110/month

Healthy small product: $110–$145/month

Busy month: $145–$180/month if DynamoDB/Lambda usage spikes 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+4
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

So my recommendation is this exact budget split:

CloudFront Pro: $15

EC2 app server: $24.53

EC2 worker: $12.26

EBS: $10

S3: $5

DynamoDB: $35

Lambda: $10

Backups/monitoring/misc: $18–$25

Target total: about $130–$137/month, leaving a small buffer under your $150/month cap.

What this can realistically handle:

400k registered users: yes

Daily active users in the low thousands: yes, if most content is cached and your API is lightweight

Concurrent users in the low hundreds, maybe higher in short bursts: plausible with CloudFront, S3, DynamoDB, and Lambda absorbing traffic

Thousands of concurrent users hitting uncached dynamic endpoints all at once: not reliably on this budget 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+2
AWS Documentation
+2

What you should avoid at this budget:

RDS as your main database unless usage is tiny

Application Load Balancer unless you truly need it

5 always-on EC2 servers

storing user uploads directly on app servers

chat, video, live streaming, or heavy AI inference on the same budget

The cheapest pattern is:

serve everything static from S3 + CloudFront

keep the main app on one small Graviton EC2

push spiky work to Lambda

store scalable app data in DynamoDB on-demand

cache aggressively so the app server does as little work as possible 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+2
AWS Documentation
+2

A blunt conclusion: yes, $1,800/year can support a product with 400k users on AWS, but only if the product is lightweight, cache-heavy, and designed for low origin load. It is not enough for a conventional “many servers + managed SQL + heavy API traffic” setup.

## User

so what would be the cheapest setup budget i need for 400k users per month including S3 storage and RDS?

## Assistant

For a cheap AWS setup that still includes EC2 + S3 + RDS, I would budget about $80–$120/month minimum, and I would treat $100–$150/month as the safer floor. That is for 400k total accounts, not 400k concurrent users. With RDS in the mix, the database becomes the main fixed cost. AWS bills RDS separately for DB instance hours, storage, backup storage, and any extra usage, so the DB is usually what sets the floor. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

The cheapest viable setup I’d use looks like this:

1 EC2 app server: t4g.small
AWS lists t4g.small at $0.0168/hour, which is about $12.26/month if it runs all month. t4g.medium is $0.0336/hour, about $24.53/month. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

EBS for that EC2 server: use gp3, not gp2
AWS’s EBS pricing example uses $0.08 per GB-month for gp3 in a region example, so 30 GB is roughly $2.40/month and 50 GB is about $4/month before snapshots. gp3 also includes baseline performance and is priced lower than gp2. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

1 small RDS Single-AZ database
AWS says RDS pricing is pay-as-you-go and the PostgreSQL pricing page points to the calculator for an estimate. RDS also includes automated backups, and backup storage up to 100% of provisioned storage is generally included before overage. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

S3 for files/uploads/assets
S3 Standard storage is $0.023/GB-month for the first 50 TB. That means 100 GB is about $2.30/month, 500 GB is about $11.50/month, and 1 TB is about $23/month, before request charges. AWS also charges for S3 requests like PUT, GET, and LIST. 
AWS Documentation
+1

No load balancer at first
ALB adds hourly and LCU charges, so it is not part of the cheapest setup. AWS explicitly bills ALB for both running hours and Load Balancer Capacity Units. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

So the practical budget floor is roughly:

EC2 + EBS: about $15–$30/month depending on t4g.small vs t4g.medium and disk size. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

S3: about $2–$25/month depending on whether you store 100 GB to 1 TB. 
AWS Documentation
+1

RDS: this is the wildcard, but it is the part that usually pushes the total into the $80+ per month range because it has a compute charge plus storage/backups. AWS’s public pricing pages confirm that structure even when the exact smallest-instance hourly rate isn’t surfaced in the snippet here. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

My blunt recommendation:

Cheapest viable monthly budget with S3 + RDS: $100/month
Safer minimum: $120–$150/month

That gets you a setup like:

1 small EC2 app server

1 small Single-AZ RDS instance

100–500 GB on S3

no ALB

low to moderate traffic

mostly cached/static content

What it can handle:

400k registered users: yes, potentially

400k active users per month: maybe, if usage is light

thousands of users hammering dynamic endpoints at once: no, not on the cheapest setup

Also keep in mind AWS gives 100 GB/month of free data transfer out across services, which helps at the low end, but past that your bandwidth costs rise. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

A good rule is:

Absolute floor: around $80–$120/month

Realistic cheap production floor: around $120–$200/month

If you want, I can turn this into a line-by-line cheapest AWS stack with exact assumptions like 100 GB S3, PostgreSQL, 1 app server, and expected monthly active users.

## User

can you give be a complete list in a table of the basic needs for the app to run, example is EC2, RDS, Load balancer, etc. just the basics needs to run and become operational and ready for auto scaling for a movie streaming app

## Assistant

Yes — for a movie streaming app, the “basic operational stack” is a bit more than a normal web app because you need both app infrastructure and a video delivery pipeline.

Here’s a practical basic AWS stack that can go live and be ready for auto scaling.

Layer	AWS service	Need level	What it does	Why it matters for a movie streaming app
DNS / domain	Route 53	Required	Points your domain to your app/CDN	Lets users reach yourapp.com, and AWS has guidance for routing Route 53 traffic to CloudFront. 
AWS Documentation

SSL certificate	AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)	Required	HTTPS/TLS certificates	Needed so login, payments, and video delivery run over HTTPS.
Network	Amazon VPC	Required	Your isolated AWS network	Standard base for subnets, routing, security groups, and multi-AZ layout. AWS describes VPC as a logically isolated virtual network. 
AWS Documentation

Network security	Security Groups	Required	Firewall rules for EC2, ALB, RDS	Controls who can reach your app servers and database.
Compute	EC2	Required	Runs your web app, API, admin panel, background services	Your backend, auth, billing, recommendation logic, admin CMS, etc.
Scaling config	Launch Template	Required	Blueprint for EC2 instances	Needed so Auto Scaling can launch identical new app servers. 
AWS Documentation

Traffic entry point	Application Load Balancer (ALB)	Required	Distributes traffic across app servers	AWS recommends ALB for load-balanced Auto Scaling setups, and it works directly with Auto Scaling groups. 
AWS Documentation
+1

Server auto scaling	EC2 Auto Scaling Group	Required	Adds/removes EC2 instances automatically	Core service for scaling app servers based on demand and health checks. AWS says EC2 Auto Scaling launches/terminates instances automatically using scaling policies and health checks. 
AWS Documentation
+1

Relational database	Amazon RDS	Required	Stores users, subscriptions, watch history, catalog metadata, payments metadata	Best fit for transactional app data. For production, high availability usually means Multi-AZ. AWS says Multi-AZ RDS can place writer/reader instances across separate Availability Zones. 
AWS Documentation

Object storage	Amazon S3	Required	Stores videos, thumbnails, subtitles, posters, logs, uploads	Core storage layer for media assets; AWS describes S3 as object storage for storing and retrieving any amount of data. 
AWS Documentation
+1

CDN	Amazon CloudFront	Required	Caches and delivers content close to viewers	Essential for streaming performance and lowering origin load. AWS says CloudFront caching serves objects from edge locations closer to users and reduces origin load and latency. 
AWS Documentation

Video processing	AWS Elemental MediaConvert	Required for VOD	Transcodes uploaded movies into streaming-friendly formats and bitrates	For a Netflix-style app, uploaded source files must be converted into ABR outputs for different devices and network speeds. AWS says MediaConvert is a file-based video processing service for scalable video transcoding and ABR outputs. 
AWS Documentation
+1

Monitoring	Amazon CloudWatch	Required	Metrics, logs, alarms	Needed to watch CPU, memory, errors, latency, scaling events, and failures. AWS describes CloudWatch as a reliable, scalable monitoring solution. 
AWS Documentation

Access control	IAM	Required	Permissions for people and services	Controls what your app servers, developers, and CI/CD can access. AWS documents IAM-based access management across services like VPC. 
AWS Documentation

Web app protection	AWS WAF	Strongly recommended	Filters malicious web requests	Helps protect ALB/CloudFront against bad traffic, bot abuse, and common web attacks. AWS says WAF can protect CloudFront distributions and Application Load Balancers. 
AWS Documentation
+1

DDoS baseline	AWS Shield Standard	Included / recommended	Basic DDoS protection	Useful for public streaming apps exposed on the internet. AWS groups Shield with WAF as the DDoS/web protection stack. 
AWS Documentation
Minimum production architecture

If you want the smallest serious setup, it would usually be:

Route 53

ACM

VPC with public and private subnets across at least 2 Availability Zones

ALB

EC2 Auto Scaling Group

RDS

S3

CloudFront

MediaConvert

CloudWatch

IAM

WAF

That is the core stack that makes the app operational, scalable, and production-ready for a VOD movie platform. AWS’s own Auto Scaling guidance ties together launch template + ALB + Auto Scaling group, while CloudFront reduces origin load and MediaConvert prepares the video files for streaming delivery. 
AWS Documentation

What each part serves in plain English
Function in your app	Service
Website / API / login / subscription logic	EC2
Adds more app servers when traffic rises	Auto Scaling Group
Sends traffic to healthy app servers	ALB
Stores user data and catalog data	RDS
Stores movie files and images	S3
Delivers movies fast worldwide	CloudFront
Converts uploaded masters into streaming renditions	MediaConvert
Provides domain and routing	Route 53
Secures HTTPS	ACM
Monitors uptime and load	CloudWatch
Controls permissions	IAM
Blocks malicious traffic	WAF
A few things that are not strictly “basic,” but you will likely want soon
Service	Why you may add it
ElastiCache / Redis	Faster sessions, caching, rate limiting, homepage/catalog speed
SQS	Decouple background jobs like email, notifications, ingestion
AWS Secrets Manager	Safer DB/API secret storage
CloudFront signed URLs/cookies	Restrict who can watch paid/protected videos
AWS KMS	Encryption key management
DRM / advanced packaging stack	Needed if studios/licensing require stronger content protection
Best “basic” launch recommendation

For a first real launch, I’d suggest this layout:

2 EC2 app instances minimum

1 ALB

1 Auto Scaling Group

1 RDS database

1 S3 bucket for media

1 CloudFront distribution

MediaConvert for ingestion/transcoding

WAF on CloudFront

CloudWatch alarms

That gives you a setup that is not just running, but also ready to scale horizontally when usage grows. AWS specifically notes that ALB and Auto Scaling integrate so instances launched by the Auto Scaling group are automatically registered and deregistered with the load balancer. 
AWS Documentation

I can also turn this into a cheapest possible AWS architecture table with estimated monthly costs for a streaming app.
