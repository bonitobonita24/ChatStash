## Assistant

Since you’re using a Spec-Driven AI Development workflow, the quality of PRODUCT.md directly determines how good your generated architecture, schema, API, and UI will be.

The prompt you showed is already excellent, but the key challenge is:

How do I fill this if the product idea is still vague?

Below is a structured way to answer each section so Copilot/AI agents can reason correctly when generating your system.

How to Fill the PRODUCT.md Prompt Properly
0) One-paragraph summary

Goal: Describe the product at a high level.

Write:

What the product is

Who it is for

What the main activity is

What success looks like

Example (for your Arena social app idea)
Markdown
Countdown Arena is a social media platform where users participate in time-based competitive challenges called Arenas. Each Arena has a theme, a countdown entry phase, and a voting phase where the community decides the winner. The platform is designed for creators and casual users who enjoy competitive content creation and discovery through a TikTok-style entertainment feed. Users can join Arenas, submit entries, vote on others, and browse past or ongoing competitions. Success means high user participation, engaging voting interactions, and a constantly refreshing feed of competitive content.

Think product pitch, not technical description.

1) App identity
App Name

Your product name.

Example:

Countdown Arena
Tagline

Short marketing line.

Examples:

"Compete. Create. Win."

or

"Where the internet battles."
Primary user value

What users gain from using the app.

Example:

Users can join themed creative competitions, showcase their content, and compete for community recognition through voting.
Non-goals

This section is very important for AI agents.

It tells the system what NOT to build.

Example:

- Not a traditional messaging platform
- Not a marketplace
- Not a professional portfolio platform
- Not a long-form content publishing platform

This prevents feature creep in generated code.

2) Personas & roles
Personas (human descriptions)

These are behavioral users, not technical roles.

Example:

Persona A — Casual Viewer
A user who scrolls the feed to watch competitions and vote but rarely participates.
Persona B — Creator Competitor
A user who frequently joins Arenas and uploads entries to compete and gain recognition.
Persona C — Community Moderator
A trusted user responsible for reviewing reported entries and enforcing platform rules.
System roles (RBAC)

These are technical permissions.

Example:

viewer — can browse public arenas and entries but cannot vote or submit

user — can create profile, join arenas, submit entries, vote, comment

moderator — can remove entries, ban users, resolve reports

admin — full platform control including user management and arena creation
3) Core entities & relationships

This section is CRITICAL because it becomes:

Prisma schema

Database tables

NestJS services

API endpoints

Entity: User

Example:

Fields:
id
email
displayName
avatarUrl
bio
status
role
createdAt
updatedAt

Relationships:

hasMany entries
hasMany votes
hasMany comments
hasMany notifications
Entity: Arena
Fields:
id
title
description
theme
status (entry_open | voting | closed)
entryDeadline
votingDeadline
createdBy
createdAt

Relationships:

hasMany entries
belongsTo creator (User)
Entity: Entry
Fields:
id
arenaId
userId
mediaUrl
caption
createdAt

Relationships:

belongsTo arena
belongsTo user
hasMany votes
Entity: Vote
Fields:
id
entryId
userId
createdAt

Constraints:

unique(userId, entryId)
Entity: Comment
Fields:
id
entryId
userId
text
createdAt

This section helps AI generate:

Prisma models

NestJS modules

validation schemas

4) Primary workflows

This becomes:

API endpoints

service logic

UI flows

Workflow A — Join Arena and Submit Entry
1) User opens Arena page
2) System checks arena status = entry_open
3) User uploads media
4) System validates file type and size
5) System stores entry record
6) Entry appears in arena feed
Workflow B — Vote on Entries
1) User opens voting feed
2) System loads entries for active arena
3) User votes on an entry
4) System validates user hasn't voted on that entry
5) Vote stored in database
6) Vote count updates
Workflow C — Discover Arenas
1) User opens home feed
2) System loads trending arenas and entries
3) User scrolls vertically
4) System loads more entries via cursor pagination
5) Screens & navigation

This becomes Next.js routes.

Public screens
/
Landing page

/auth/login

/auth/callback
App screens
/feed

/arena/[arenaId]

/entry/[entryId]

/profile/[username]

/submit-entry
Admin screens
/admin

/admin/arenas

/admin/users

/admin/reports
6) API expectations

Your stack suggests:

NestJS

REST

Versioned API

Example:

API base path: /api/v1

Response format:
{
  code,
  message,
  requestId,
  data,
  error
}

Pagination:
cursor-based
7) Authentication & authorization

Since you're using Keycloak, define:

Keycloak realm name: arena-platform
Login method
email/password
future: Google login
JWT claims mapping

Example:

userId → sub
roles → realm_access.roles
tenantId → none (single tenant)
8) Tenancy model

Your app likely:

Tenancy mode: single

Future SaaS possibility:

future multi-tenant via row partition
9) Data sensitivity

For social apps:

Contains PII: yes
(email, username, profile info)

Example policies:

Retention: indefinite unless user deletes
Right-to-delete: yes
Data export: yes

Audit logs:

login
account deletion
role change
content deletion
10) Storage & uploads

Your app requires media.

Example:

Upload types: images, video
Max size: 50MB
MIME: image/jpeg, image/png, video/mp4

Objects:

Public objects: entries
Private objects: avatars (optional)

Buckets:

avatars
entries
thumbnails
11) Realtime requirements

Example:

Features:
live vote counts
arena countdown timers

Transport:

WebSockets
12) Background jobs

BullMQ examples:

Job: Close Arena Entry Phase

Trigger:

entryDeadline reached

Steps:

1) mark arena status = voting
2) notify participants
Job: Close Voting Phase
1) calculate winners
2) update leaderboard
3) notify participants
13) Notifications

Example:

Email: yes (welcome, password reset)
In-app: yes
Push: later

Triggers:

new arena
entry receives votes
arena results announced
14) Performance & scale

Even rough numbers help AI:

Example:

Expected DAU: 50k
Peak RPS: 500
Uploads/day: 10k
DB size: 1TB long-term
15) Environments

Example:

dev
stage
prod

Local:

web: http://localhost:3000
api: http://localhost:3001
16) Observability

Your stack already includes:

Logs: pino
Metrics: Prometheus
Tracing: OpenTelemetry (later)
17) Security

Example:

CORS: restricted
CSRF: yes
Rate limit: 100 req/min per user

Admin protection:

role = admin only
18) Acceptance criteria

These become system validation checks.

Example:

User can create account
User can join arena
User can submit entry
User can vote
Voting results computed correctly
Admin can moderate content
19) Open questions

Leave unresolved items:

Should arenas allow multiple entries?
Should voting be anonymous?
Should there be rewards?

These guide Copilot Discovery Phase.

Critical Tip for Your Spec-Driven Workflow

Your PRODUCT.md must avoid implementation details like:

❌ don't write:

use prisma
use redis
use nextjs

Because those are already defined in your architecture spec.

PRODUCT.md should describe:

product behavior

entities

workflows

rules

If you want, I can also generate a FULL completed PRODUCT.md for your Countdown Arena app that is perfectly optimized for your Spec-Driven AI development system (Next.js + NestJS + Prisma + Keycloak + BullMQ + MinIO).

That will save you hours of architecture iteration.

## User

- no, what I'm about to build is not for Countdown Arena.
- I'm want to build a Fisherfolk Management System
- Full fisherfolk profiling + operations
- Registration, livelihoods, vessels, permits, catch monitoring, reporting
- Registration data includes:
1. ID Number ( manual input, must be unique )
2. Full Name ( Last Name, First Name, Middle Name, must be unique, no multiple ID can be in one full name )
3. Date of Birth (MM/DD/YYYY)
4. Address (Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro ready selection of barangays)
5. Sex ( Selection of Male or Female)
6. Image ( Upload or via webcam/phone camera options with auto crop to 1x1 ratio)
7. Signature ( Upload or via stylus pen drawing options auto cropping to signed image area )
8. RSBSA Number ( manual input, must be unique )
9. Contact number ( Manual input, must be saved with +63 prefix then starts with number 9 to be filled )
10. Fisherfolk Category type Selection ( can multi-select ): 
a. Boat Owner/Operator
b. Capture Fishing
c. Gleaning
d. Vendor
e. Fish Processing
f. Aquaculture
11. Is President? ( Just a clickable check box, if clicked/checked means that the currently registering fisherfolk is a President in his barangay based on the address selected )

- this Fisherfolk Management System is just a module/app which will a part of a bigger system or an enterprise system
- I just want to start from this app because this is the foundation and first entry of data that will be used in the next app or module inside the enterprise system
- another module or app is Vessel registration, type, tonnage, licensing, Fishing Gears - Gear types, quantities, associations, Permits & Licenses
- Permits, renewal tracking, Programs / Interventions - Government programs, beneficiaries, distribution, Catch / Harvest records - Species, volume, landing sites, dates

## Assistant

Got it — you’re building a Fisherfolk Management System (FMS) module that becomes the master data foundation for a larger enterprise platform. Below is a ready-to-paste PRODUCT.md content (fill-in style but already concrete), optimized for spec-driven generation.

0) One-paragraph summary (required)

The Fisherfolk Management System (FMS) is a government operations module for managing complete fisherfolk profiles and field operations data in Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro. It supports registration and identity capture (photo + signature), categorization by livelihood types, and links each fisherfolk to vessels, gears, permits, programs, and catch/harvest monitoring. The system is intended for LGU/agency staff, field enumerators, and administrators who need reliable, searchable records, compliance tracking, and reporting. Success means high-quality unique profiles, fast lookup, minimal duplicates, traceable updates, and accurate operational reports usable by downstream enterprise modules.

1) App identity (required)

App Name: Fisherfolk Management System (FMS)

Tagline: “Unified fisherfolk profiling and operations tracking.”

Primary user value: Centralized, validated fisherfolk master records that connect to vessels, permits, programs, and catch monitoring for compliance and reporting.

Non-goals (explicitly out of scope):

Full accounting/financial management

Public-facing social/community features

E-commerce marketplace

GIS-grade vessel tracking (future module)

National registry synchronization (future; unless explicitly required)

2) Personas & roles (required)
Personas (human descriptions)

Persona A: Registration Clerk (City Hall staff)
Registers fisherfolk, verifies documents, edits records, prints/export lists.

Persona B: Field Enumerator (mobile-first user)
Captures registrations on-site (photo/signature), later syncs, needs fast search.

Persona C: Program Officer / Analyst
Generates reports, monitors beneficiaries, checks permit renewal status and catch summaries.

System roles (for RBAC)

Role: viewer — can search and view fisherfolk profiles and reports; no create/edit/delete

Role: user — can create profiles, edit allowed fields, attach media (photo/signature), create operational records (catch/program entries) based on permissions

Role: moderator — can resolve duplicates, approve merges, correct critical identity fields, manage barangay reference data (if allowed)

Role: admin — full access, manage users/roles, system configuration, audit logs, export controls

Per-entity rules (important):

user cannot delete fisherfolk profiles; only moderator/admin

Only moderator/admin can edit unique identity fields (ID Number, Full Name, RSBSA Number) after initial creation (or require approval workflow)

Only admin can perform bulk imports/exports (if enabled)

3) Core entities & relationships (required)

Required events: create/update/delete, merge, role changes, exports

(Future module entities can be listed now as “planned” to influence architecture without implementing immediately.)

4) Primary workflows (required, step-by-step)
Workflow A: Register fisherfolk profile (clerk/enumerator)

User opens “New Registration”

System shows form + barangay selection list (Calapan City only)

User inputs ID Number, full name parts, DOB, sex, address barangay, RSBSA, contact number

User selects one or more fisherfolk categories

User checks “Is President?” if applicable

User captures photo (upload or camera) → system enforces 1:1 crop

User captures signature (upload or draw) → system crops to signed area

System validates uniqueness: idNumber, rsbsaNumber, fullNameNormalized

System stores Fisherfolk + joins + media objects

System responds with created profile + printable/view page

Workflow B: Search & view fisherfolk profile

User searches by ID Number / name / RSBSA / barangay

System returns paginated results with key identity fields and status

User opens profile view with linked operational records (empty if none)

Workflow C: Update fisherfolk profile

User opens profile → Edit

System enforces field-level permissions (unique identity fields gated)

System validates changes (including uniqueness if edited)

System saves update + writes AuditLog

Workflow D: Deactivate record (soft delete)

Moderator/Admin selects “Deactivate” with reason

System marks status + locks new operational entries if required

AuditLog recorded

Workflow E: Resolve duplicates (merge)

Moderator searches suspected duplicates

System compares identity fields + shows merge preview

Moderator chooses “primary record” and merges

System re-links all foreign keys to primary record

System archives secondary record + logs merge event

5) Screens & navigation (recommended)
Public screens

/: redirect to login or app (depending on auth)

/auth/login

/auth/callback

App screens (authenticated)

/dashboard: summary counts (registered today, by barangay, by category)

/fisherfolk: list + filters (barangay, category, status)

/fisherfolk/new: registration form + photo/signature capture

/fisherfolk/[id]: profile view (tabs: Profile, Vessels, Permits, Programs, Catch, Audit)

/fisherfolk/[id]/edit

/reports: predefined reports exportable

/settings/profile: user profile

Admin screens (role-gated)

/admin

/admin/users

/admin/roles

/admin/reference/barangays

/admin/reference/categories

/admin/audit-logs

/admin/import-export (if enabled)

6) API expectations (recommended)

API base path: /api/v1

Response envelope: { code, message, requestId, data, error }

Pagination: cursor-based for lists

Filtering/sorting:

?q= for search

?barangayId=

?categoryId=

?status=

?sort=createdAt:desc

Error handling:

409 Conflict for uniqueness violations (idNumber/fullName/rsbsa)

tenantId: none (single tenant for now)

RBAC rules

viewer: read-only

user: create/edit non-critical fields, add operational records

moderator: merge, deactivate, edit critical fields, resolve reports

admin: everything + user/role management + exports + reference data

8) Tenancy model (required)

Tenancy mode: single (module within a larger enterprise system)

Future-ready note: if multi-tenant later, prefer row partition (tenantId column) with strict isolation on fisherfolk and operational records.

9) Data sensitivity & governance (required)

Contains PII? yes (name, DOB, address, contact, photo, signature)

Data retention policy: retain while active + per LGU policy; soft-delete only

Data export requirement: yes (CSV/PDF reports)

Right-to-delete requirement: likely yes (but may be constrained by government record policies)

Audit log required events:

login (optional)

create/update fisherfolk

critical field changes (ID/name/RSBSA)

exports

role changes

10) Storage & uploads (required)

Upload types: images

Max file size: (recommend) 5–10MB per image

Allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp

Virus scanning required? later (recommended)

Public or private objects? private

Object lifecycle rules: delete objects only when record is permanently removed (if allowed)

Buckets needed:

fisherfolk-photos

fisherfolk-signatures

Upload workflow (presigned S3)

Client requests presign (type=photo|signature, fisherfolkId optional)

API validates size/type and returns { uploadUrl, objectKey }

Client uploads to MinIO

Client calls API to attach object to fisherfolk record

API generates derived versions if needed (thumbnail, normalized crop)

11) Realtime requirements (optional)

Not required for v1. (Optional later: live “registration count today”, but can be polling.)

12) Background jobs & async workflows (required if any)
Job: Generate report exports

Trigger: user requests export

Inputs: filters, format

Steps: query DB → generate file → store in object storage → notify user

Idempotency key: exportRequestId

Failure handling: mark failed + allow retry

DLQ + replay: yes

Job: Permit renewal reminders (future module)

Trigger: daily scheduled

Inputs: permits expiring in X days

Steps: create notifications

Scheduled: yes (daily)

13) Notifications (optional)

Email: no (v1), later optional

In-app: yes (exports ready, permit renewals later)

Push: later

14) Performance & scale (recommended)

Expected DAU/MAU: 20–200 staff users (typical LGU) + growth for enterprise usage

Peak requests/sec: low (<50 rps) but must be reliable

Upload volume/day: 50–500 images/day (depends on registrations)

DB size: grows steadily; must support years of historical operational data

15) Environments & domains (required)

Environments: dev / stage / prod

Domain/base URL:

stage: TBD

prod: TBD

Local dev URLs:

web: http://localhost:3000

api: http://localhost:3001

16) Observability requirements (recommended)

Logs: JSON in prod, pretty in dev: yes

Metrics: Prometheus: yes (optional in v1)

Tracing: OpenTelemetry: later

Health endpoints:

liveness

readiness

17) Security requirements (required)

CORS policy: allow only approved web origins

CSRF: yes (if cookie-based session); if pure JWT header auth, document approach

Rate limiting: e.g. 60 req/min/user; stricter on auth + upload presign endpoints

Admin endpoint protections: admin role only + audit logs

Allowed origins: stage/prod domains + localhost dev

Secrets handling: env-only yes

18) Acceptance criteria (required)

User can login/logout successfully via Keycloak

User can register fisherfolk profile end-to-end (including photo + signature)

Uniqueness enforcement works (ID Number, full name, RSBSA)

Contact number stored as +63 format and validated

Barangay selection list is available and restricted to Calapan City

Fisherfolk category multi-select is saved correctly

Search works (ID/name/RSBSA/barangay) with pagination

Audit logs record create/update/merge/deactivate actions

Upload works via presigned URLs and objects are private

CI passes and compose brings infra online

Health endpoints return OK

Governance guard blocks unsynced spec changes

19) Open questions (optional)

Should “Full Name uniqueness” be strict exact match, or normalized (case/spacing)?

Do we support suffixes (Jr., Sr.) and multiple middle names?

Should DOB be required or optional (some registrations may not know exact DOB)?

Should photo/signature be mandatory for registration, or optional with “pending” status?

Should offline-first mobile capture be required for field enumeration?

Are exports allowed for all roles, or admin-only?

If you want, I can also rewrite this into an even more “agent-friendly” format by:

defining exact validation regex for PH contact numbers,

specifying merge conflict rules for duplicates,

and listing future module entity stubs (Vessel, Gear, Permit, Catch, Program) so your downstream modules plug in cleanly without schema refactors.

## User

add an output view display Profile of fisherfolk's Data record if name or ID is selected or opened in searching or list view of fisherfolks

## Assistant

Good addition 👍 — this should be reflected in two places in your PRODUCT.md so the AI agents correctly generate:

a profile page UI

a GET profile API endpoint

the data aggregation logic

Below is the exact section you should add/update.

1️⃣ Update Section 4 — Primary Workflows

Add this workflow.

media

✅ UI profile layout

photo

identity

categories

signature

future module sections

💡 Pro tip for your enterprise plan

Add a Profile Sidebar Summary Card that always stays visible:

Photo
Name
ID Number
Barangay
Categories
President Badge

Then the rest of the profile becomes scrollable operational sections (vessels, permits, catch etc.).

This pattern works extremely well for government registry systems.

If you want, I can also show you 3 extremely important database design improvements for this fisherfolk system that will prevent duplicate identity records and corruption later (this is a common problem in LGU registry systems).

## User

yes please do

## Assistant

Here are 3 database design improvements that will save you from the most common LGU registry problems: duplicate people, corrupted identity, and “can’t merge later” records. These are practical, and they fit your stack (Prisma + Postgres).

1) Use a normalized “Identity Fingerprint” to enforce real name uniqueness

Your rule is: no multiple ID can be in one full name (i.e., one person record per full name).
But “full name” comparisons break easily because of:

casing (juan dela cruz vs JUAN DELA CRUZ)

extra spaces (DELA CRUZ)

punctuation (Dela-Cruz)

missing middle name / “N/A”

diacritics (rare, but happens)

What to do

Store both:

raw name fields (what user typed)

a generated normalized field used for uniqueness + search

Add fields

fullNameDisplay (computed or stored)

fullNameNormalized (stored, indexed, unique)

Normalization rules (recommended)

uppercase

trim

collapse multiple spaces to one

remove punctuation (.,-')

middle name: treat empty / “N/A” consistently

DB rule

unique(fullNameNormalized)

✅ Result: you enforce your “one person per name” rule reliably.

2) Separate “Citizen Identity” from “Operational Person Record” (future-proofing)

Since this module is the foundation for a bigger enterprise system, you want to avoid this trap:

Future modules create duplicates because each module saves identity fields again.

What to do

Create a stable core entity (person identity) and let modules reference it.

Option A (simple now): keep Fisherfolk as the core person record
and ensure every future module references fisherfolkId only.

Option B (best for enterprise): create a Person table now, and FisherfolkProfile extends it.

Person: name, DOB, sex, contact, address, photo/signature

FisherfolkProfile: fisherfolk categories, RSBSA, president flag, domain-specific fields

✅ Result: if later you add “Farmer”, “Vendor”, “Beneficiary”, etc., it’s the same person with multiple profiles, not duplicates.

If you don’t want complexity yet, do Option A but name your Fisherfolk fields as “person-ish” and keep it clean.

3) Build duplicate handling into the model: soft-delete + merge lineage + immutable IDs

In real deployments, duplicates are inevitable:

someone registers twice

spelling differs slightly

clerk makes a new record instead of searching

If you don’t design for merges early, your database gets stuck.

What to do (minimum)

Soft-delete + merge metadata

Add fields to Fisherfolk:

status (active|inactive|merged|deceased|moved)

mergedIntoId (nullable FK → Fisherfolk.id)

mergeReason (text)

mergedAt (datetime)

Merge rule

If record is merged, it becomes read-only

All future references should resolve to the “primary” record:

when fetching a record, if mergedIntoId exists, redirect to that profile

✅ Result: you can safely merge records later without breaking foreign keys.

Bonus: Immutable identity keys

Never allow normal users to edit:

idNumber

rsbsaNumber

fullNameNormalized

Only moderator/admin (and log it in AuditLog).

Suggested Prisma/DB constraints summary (copy into PRODUCT.md)

Put this under Entity: Fisherfolk → Constraints

idNumber unique

rsbsaNumber unique

fullNameNormalized unique (generated from name parts)

contactNumberE164 validated to +63 + 9xxxxxxxxx

mergedIntoId nullable FK; when not null, status must be merged

indexes:

barangayId

status

fullNameNormalized

idNumber, rsbsaNumber

One more extremely practical tip (PH LGU reality)

Many people share the same exact full name. Your strict rule “one full name = one person” will eventually block valid registrations.

A safer rule is:

Unique: idNumber and/or rsbsaNumber

Name uniqueness becomes “warn + review”, not hard-block

If your policy truly requires name uniqueness, keep it — but expect false positives.

If you want, I can give you a merge workflow spec (UI + API + DB steps) that’s safe and audit-able, and works even after you add the Vessel/Permit/Catch modules.

## User

- ok that's a good offer, please save that.
- before we do that i also want to add another app or a module that is dependent to FMS
- i want this to be an independent module thou is relies on FMO app as boat owner because they tend to manage vessels information too.
- Register vessels, link to owner, renewal cycle, Permit application workflow - Apply, review, approve, print permits, Catch reporting / fish landing - Log catches per landing site/trip with species & volume, Program enrollment & distribution - Create programs, enroll beneficiaries, track distribution, Reporting & analytics dashboard
- please gather pertinent data needed for this for i dont have specifics of the data needed but the idea is there already
- for now we have 2 modules or apps already as part of the enterprise ecosystem
- every app or modules we build must in a modern left side menu following it sub menus to offer per apps or modules
- our main dashboard will be latest charts of possible reports that you can imagine that is related to this project

## Assistant

Saved. ✅ (The 3 DB improvements + merge/lineage approach are now in memory for this project.)

Now, for your 2nd module/app (dependent on FMS but independently deployable), here’s a pertinent data blueprint you can drop into a new PRODUCT.md later, even if you don’t know every detail yet.

Module 2: Vessel, Permits, Catch, Programs, Reporting
Suggested module name

Fisherfolk Operations Module (FOM)
(Depends on FMS for “owner” identity, but can run as its own app/module.)

Dependency rule

A Vessel Owner must reference an existing FMS Fisherfolk record.

If an owner isn’t found, user is redirected to FMS registration (or shown “create new fisherfolk” link if integrated).

A) Core Entities You’ll Need
1) Vessel

Purpose: Register boats and link to owner(s).

Fields (recommended):

id

registrationNumber (unique; may be LGU-issued)

name (optional)

ownerFisherfolkId (FK → FMS Fisherfolk)

barangayId (redundant copy for reporting speed; still source-of-truth is owner address)

vesselType (motorized | non-motorized | outrigger | etc.)

hullMaterial (wood | fiberglass | aluminum | other)

lengthM, widthM, grossTonnage (optional but useful)

engineType (inboard/outboard/none), engineHp (optional)

homePort / landingSiteDefaultId (optional)

notes

B) Primary Workflows (for spec-driven generation)
Workflow 1: Register vessel + link owner

User opens Vessels → New

System searches/selects owner from FMS (by ID/Name)

User encodes vessel details

System validates unique registrationNumber

System saves vessel and shows vessel profile page

Workflow 2: Permit application (apply → review → approve → print)

Staff creates application (select permit type + applicant + vessel if required)

Submit for review

Reviewer checks requirements, sets under_review → approved/rejected

On approval, system generates validFrom/validTo based on permitType validity

Print permit: generate PDF, store in MinIO, mark printed, assign documentNo

Permit becomes visible in vessel/profile history

Workflow 3: Renewal tracking

System lists permits expiring in N days

Staff triggers renewal (clone application + update dates)

Notifications or dashboard cards show due renewals

Workflow 4: Catch reporting / fish landing

User selects fisherfolk and vessel (optional)

Select landing site + date/time

Add multiple species items and weights

Save report

Dashboard aggregates totals by date/site/species/barangay

Workflow 5: Program enrollment & distribution

Admin creates program

Staff enrolls beneficiaries (from FMS)

Staff records distributions with item + qty per beneficiary

Reports show coverage, totals distributed, beneficiaries per barangay/category

C) Left-side Menu Requirement (Modern Admin UI)

You said: every module/app must have a modern left-side menu with submenus.

Enterprise Shell (top-level)

Dashboard

This structure also maps cleanly to Next.js routes.

D) Main Dashboard: “Latest charts you can imagine”

Here are high-value charts/cards that fit your data and feel “modern”:

Quick KPI cards

Beneficiaries by program (bar chart)

Registrations by barangay (bar chart)

Tables

Latest catch reports (most recent)

Permits due for renewal (sorted by soonest expiry)

Recent registrations / edits (audit-driven)

Next step (no waiting): I can “save” this module blueprint too

If you want me to store it as well (like we did earlier), tell me and I’ll save:

module name + dependency rule

entity list (Vessel/Permit/Catch/Program)

left-menu IA

dashboard chart set

Also: when you’re ready, I can convert this into a clean PRODUCT.md for Module 2 that matches your spec-driven pipeline exactly.

## User

- ok do it but please change first the Suggested module name to Vessel Management System (FMS), we will be using that name on our next module later
- just to clarify your thoughts "dependent on FMS but independently deployable", yes its dependent on FMS and independent app but not deployable if your saying that it will be deployed later or separately to the server. Save this thought, " all of our modules or apps that we are going to build in this enterprise ecosystem will be viewed as menus in a large workspace, with sub menus when selected to show specific available operations per menu and those menus will have its own permissions if a user level is granted to access or not

## Assistant

Done — updated and saved. ✅

Changes applied

Suggested module name is now: Vessel Management System (VMS) (instead of Fisherfolk Operations Module).

Saved your clarification that “independent app” means logically separate module, but not necessarily separately deployed. In your ecosystem, modules are menus inside one workspace.

Saved the enterprise UX/RBAC rule: each module/menu (and its submenus) has its own permissions; users only see/enter modules they’re granted.

What I saved (so we can reuse later)

VMS blueprint: core entities (Vessel, Ownership History, Permit Types, Permit Application workflow, Permit Documents, Landing Sites, Species, Catch Reports + items, Programs + enrollments + distributions)

Module dependency rule: VMS relies on FMS fisherfolk records for owners/applicants/beneficiaries

Workspace navigation IA: left-side menu with submenus per module

Dashboard chart ideas: KPIs + catch/permit/program analytics

Whenever you’re ready, tell me “generate VMS PRODUCT.md”, and I’ll output a complete PRODUCT.md for the Vessel Management System (VMS) that matches your spec-driven format and your workspace/menu permission model.

## User

so how about the first module we built? the FMS? will it be also included in the PRODUCT.md?

## Assistant

Yes — and this is very important for your Spec-Driven architecture.

Short answer:

Yes, the Fisherfolk Management System (FMS) must have its own PRODUCT.md.

But the enterprise platform itself should also have a top-level PRODUCT.md describing the whole ecosystem and modules.

So you will have 2 levels of PRODUCT.md.

1️⃣ Level 1 — Enterprise PRODUCT.md (Workspace level)

This describes the entire ecosystem, not the details of each module.

Purpose:

Define the workspace

Define modules

Define shared identity

Define global navigation

Define RBAC model

Example structure:

docs/
 ├─ PRODUCT.md              ← Enterprise platform
 ├─ modules/
 │   ├─ fms/
 │   │   └─ PRODUCT.md      ← Fisherfolk Management System
 │   ├─ vms/
 │   │   └─ PRODUCT.md      ← Vessel Management System
Example Enterprise PRODUCT.md
Summary

The system is an enterprise fisheries management platform used by LGUs to manage fisherfolk registration, vessel records, permits, catch monitoring, and government program interventions. The platform is composed of multiple operational modules that share a unified workspace and authentication system. Each module provides domain-specific tools but relies on shared master data such as fisherfolk identities. Users access modules through a left-side workspace menu, and permissions determine which modules and operations are visible.

Modules
Module	Purpose
FMS	Fisherfolk master data registry
VMS	Vessel registration and permits
Catch Monitoring (future)	Fisheries production monitoring
Programs & Interventions (future)	Government support programs
Analytics	Reporting and dashboards

Shared Master Data

The system uses shared master data across modules.

Primary master entities:

Fisherfolk (FMS)
Barangay
Species
Landing Sites
Permit Types
Gear Types

Example dependency:

VMS → requires Fisherfolk from FMS
Catch Monitoring → requires Vessel from VMS
Programs → requires Fisherfolk from FMS
RBAC Model

Roles apply across modules, but permissions are module-scoped.

Example:

Role	Access
viewer	read-only
user	operational actions
moderator	data correction + merge
admin	full system

Permissions example:

FMS.create_fisherfolk
FMS.edit_fisherfolk
VMS.create_vessel
VMS.approve_permit
PROGRAMS.manage
ADMIN.users
2️⃣ Level 2 — Module PRODUCT.md (FMS / VMS)

Each module has its own detailed spec.

Example:

modules/fms/PRODUCT.md

This contains:

Fisherfolk entity

Registration workflow

Photo + signature upload

Duplicate detection

Profile display

Reports

And

modules/vms/PRODUCT.md

Contains:

Vessel entity

Permit workflow

Catch reports

Programs

dashboards

3️⃣ Why this matters for AI Spec-Driven Development

This structure lets your AI agents understand:

Enterprise level

system architecture

module relationships

navigation structure

Module level

entities

APIs

workflows

UI pages

Without this separation, AI agents often:

mix entities

generate wrong dependencies

duplicate models

4️⃣ Final architecture recommendation

Your repo structure should look like this:

docs/
   PRODUCT.md                 ← Enterprise system

modules/
   fms/
      PRODUCT.md              ← Fisherfolk Management System

   vms/
      PRODUCT.md              ← Vessel Management System

apps/
   web/
   api/

packages/
   db
   ui

This structure works perfectly with your pnpm + turbo monorepo + spec-driven pipeline.

5️⃣ One more thing you should define early (very important)

Because your system is LGU operations software, the enterprise PRODUCT.md should also define:

Geographic scope
City: Calapan City
Province: Oriental Mindoro
Barangays: predefined list

This helps the system generate:

dropdown lists

report filters

geographic aggregations

✅ If you want, I can also generate a complete Enterprise PRODUCT.md for your ecosystem that includes:

workspace architecture

module dependencies

RBAC permission matrix

dashboard analytics model

data governance rules

It will make your AI-generated architecture much cleaner and more scalable.

## User

yes sure, i like your plan and it sounds like plan now. lets do it

## Assistant

Great. Let’s establish the Enterprise PRODUCT.md now.
This will become the root product specification that your AI Spec-Driven system uses to understand the whole ecosystem, while each module (FMS, VMS, etc.) will have its own detailed PRODUCT.md.

Below is a clean, ready-to-use Enterprise PRODUCT.md tailored to everything you described.

Enterprise PRODUCT.md

(Root spec for the Fisheries Management Enterprise System)

0) One-paragraph summary

The Fisheries Management Enterprise System is a government operations platform designed to manage fisherfolk registration, vessel records, permits, catch monitoring, and program interventions within Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro. The platform is organized into multiple domain modules such as the Fisherfolk Management System (FMS) and Vessel Management System (VMS), which operate within a unified workspace and share common master data. Each module provides specialized operational capabilities while relying on shared identity and reference data to maintain consistency across the ecosystem. The system is used by LGU staff, field enumerators, program officers, and administrators to maintain accurate fisheries data, track compliance, manage permits, and generate analytical reports for policy and planning.

1) App identity

Platform Name: Fisheries Management Enterprise System

Tagline:
Unified fisheries data, compliance, and operations management.

Primary user value

The platform provides a centralized operational workspace where LGU staff can register fisherfolk, manage vessels and permits, record catch data, administer government programs, and generate analytics for fisheries governance.

Non-goals

The platform is NOT intended to provide:

public social networking

online seafood marketplaces

financial accounting systems

GPS vessel tracking (possible future system)

national-level fisheries registry synchronization (future integration)

2) Ecosystem architecture

The platform is composed of independent functional modules that operate inside a single enterprise workspace.

Modules are logically independent but share common infrastructure and master data.

Modules appear as menus within a unified application interface.

Users access modules based on role permissions.

3) Current modules
Fisherfolk Management System (FMS)

Purpose:

Maintain the master registry of fisherfolk identities.

Core functions:

fisherfolk registration

profile management

identity verification

fisherfolk categorization

photo & signature capture

fisherfolk search and lookup

reporting

Dependencies:

This module acts as master data for other modules.

Vessel Management System (VMS)

Purpose:

Manage vessel registration, permit applications, catch reporting, and fisheries operational records.

Core functions:

vessel registration

owner linking (to FMS)

permit application workflow

permit approval and printing

permit renewal tracking

catch / fish landing reports

government program enrollment

beneficiary distribution tracking

analytics dashboards

Dependencies:

Requires fisherfolk identity records from FMS.

4) Future modules (planned)

These may later be separated but are conceptually part of the ecosystem.

Catch Monitoring & Fisheries Production

catch analytics

species monitoring

production trends

landing site reporting

Programs & Interventions

livelihood programs

equipment distributions

fisherfolk training programs

beneficiary tracking

Analytics & Reporting

system dashboards

fisheries policy analytics

LGU reporting

5) Workspace navigation model

The system uses a modern left-side workspace navigation.

Menus represent modules.

Each module expands into submenus representing operations.

Example navigation:

Dashboard

Fisherfolk Management System
    Fisherfolk List
    Register Fisherfolk
    Reports

Vessel Management System
    Vessels
    Permit Applications
    Permit Renewals
    Printed Permits
    Catch Reports
    Programs
    Distributions

Analytics
    Catch Analytics
    Registrations
    Permits

Administration
    Users
    Roles
    Reference Data
    Audit Logs

Menus are visible only if the user role has permission.

6) Geographic scope

Initial deployment scope:

City: Calapan City
Province: Oriental Mindoro
Country: Philippines

Address data uses predefined barangay reference lists.

Barangays are selected from a controlled dataset.

7) Shared master data

Certain data entities are shared across modules.

Primary shared entities:

Fisherfolk
Barangay
Species
Landing Sites
Permit Types
Fishing Gear Types
Programs

Example relationships:

VMS → references fisherfolk from FMS
Catch Reports → reference vessels from VMS
Programs → reference fisherfolk from FMS
8) Authentication & authorization

Authentication uses a centralized identity provider.

Example:

Keycloak or equivalent identity system.

Roles are assigned per user.

Example system roles:

viewer
user
moderator
admin

Permissions are module-scoped.

Example permissions:

FMS.create_fisherfolk
FMS.edit_fisherfolk
FMS.view_profiles

VMS.register_vessel
VMS.apply_permit
VMS.approve_permit

PROGRAMS.manage

ADMIN.manage_users
9) Data governance

The system stores personally identifiable information (PII).

Examples:

names

birthdates

contact numbers

addresses

photos

signatures

Governance requirements:

audit logging of critical operations

controlled editing of identity fields

soft deletion policies

data export controls

Critical actions requiring audit logs:

fisherfolk registration
profile edits
identity field changes
permit approvals
permit printing
record merges
user role changes
data exports
10) Dashboard overview

The main dashboard provides high-level analytics.

Key indicators

total registered fisherfolk

total vessels

permits issued

permits expiring soon

total catch volume

program beneficiaries

Charts

Possible charts include:

fisherfolk registrations by barangay

catch volume trends

catch by species

landing site activity

permit approval statistics

program distribution summaries

11) System environments

The system runs across three environments:

development
staging
production

Local development URLs:

web: http://localhost:3000
api: http://localhost:3001
12) Observability

System monitoring includes:

structured logging

health endpoints

error tracking

optional metrics monitoring

Health endpoints:

/health/liveness
/health/readiness
13) Security requirements

Security controls include:

role-based access control

restricted admin endpoints

secure file uploads

secrets stored via environment variables

CORS restrictions

rate limiting on APIs

14) Acceptance criteria

The enterprise system is considered operational when:

users can authenticate and access the workspace

modules appear based on user permissions

fisherfolk can be registered and viewed

vessels can be registered and linked to owners

permits can be processed through the workflow

catch reports can be recorded

dashboard analytics display system data

audit logs record system actions

infrastructure services start successfully via Docker

Recommended repository structure

For your spec-driven architecture, use this structure:

docs/
    PRODUCT.md          ← Enterprise product definition

modules/
    fms/
        PRODUCT.md      ← Fisherfolk Management System

    vms/
        PRODUCT.md      ← Vessel Management System
What we should do next (recommended order)

Now that the enterprise PRODUCT.md is defined, the ideal next steps are:

Step 1

Finalize

modules/fms/PRODUCT.md

This defines:

fisherfolk entity

registration workflow

duplicate prevention

photo & signature capture

fisherfolk profile page

Step 2

Create

modules/vms/PRODUCT.md

This defines:

vessels

permits

catch reporting

programs

dashboards

Step 3

Run your AI spec-driven discovery phase to generate:

Prisma schema

NestJS modules

API endpoints

Next.js routes

dashboards

✅ If you want, the next extremely useful step is that I generate the complete modules/fms/PRODUCT.md based on all the fisherfolk registration fields you gave earlier — properly structured so your AI pipeline will generate the database, API, and UI correctly.

## User

ok just to clarify something first, should I just copy everything from "Enterprise PRODUCT.md" sentence and paster it to my PRODUCT.md file?

## Assistant

Yes — but with one important clarification for your Spec-Driven workflow.

You should copy the Enterprise PRODUCT.md content into docs/PRODUCT.md, not into the module PRODUCT.md.

So the rule is:

docs/PRODUCT.md                ← Enterprise PRODUCT (copy the whole thing)

docs/modules/fms/PRODUCT.md    ← Fisherfolk module spec
docs/modules/vms/PRODUCT.md    ← Vessel module spec

Your Enterprise PRODUCT.md describes the entire ecosystem, while the module PRODUCT.md files describe detailed system behavior per module.

1️⃣ What you should do right now

Create this file:

docs/PRODUCT.md

Then paste the Enterprise PRODUCT.md I generated exactly as it is.

You do not need to modify anything yet.

2️⃣ Your correct project spec structure

For your Spec-Driven system, the clean structure should be:

docs/
│
├─ PRODUCT.md                ← Enterprise system definition
│
└─ modules/
    │
    ├─ fms/
    │   └─ PRODUCT.md        ← Fisherfolk Management System
    │
    └─ vms/
        └─ PRODUCT.md        ← Vessel Management System
3️⃣ Why this matters for your AI platform

Your AI pipeline will use the specs like this:

Spec	Purpose
Enterprise PRODUCT.md	system architecture, modules, workspace navigation
FMS PRODUCT.md	fisherfolk registry rules
VMS PRODUCT.md	vessel/permit/catch operations

This prevents AI from:

❌ mixing vessel fields into fisherfolk tables
❌ generating duplicate APIs
❌ creating wrong dependencies

4️⃣ What happens after you paste it

When you run your Spec-Driven discovery phase, the AI will already know:

the platform has modules

the first module is FMS

the second module is VMS

modules appear as menus in a workspace

modules share master data

So your generated architecture will align with your plan.

5️⃣ One small improvement before you run discovery (recommended)

Add this small section to the bottom of the Enterprise PRODUCT.md.

Module Boundaries
FMS (Fisherfolk Management System)
Owns fisherfolk identity and master records.

VMS (Vessel Management System)
Owns vessels, permits, catch reporting, and program operations.

Other modules must reference these master entities instead of duplicating them.

This helps the AI enforce data ownership rules.

6️⃣ Your next best step

After you paste the Enterprise PRODUCT.md:

We should immediately generate:

docs/modules/fms/PRODUCT.md

because FMS is the foundation module.

Once FMS is defined properly, the VMS module can safely depend on it.

If you'd like, I can now generate the complete FMS PRODUCT.md (based on your exact fisherfolk fields, photo capture, signature capture, and uniqueness rules).
That one will be very important because it defines the core identity data of your entire system.

Below is a complete, ready-to-paste docs/modules/fms/PRODUCT.md for your Fisherfolk Management System (FMS) module, aligned with your enterprise workspace/menu model and your exact registration requirements.

Fisherfolk Management System (FMS) — PRODUCT.md
0) One-paragraph summary (required)

The Fisherfolk Management System (FMS) is the master data module of the Fisheries Management Enterprise System responsible for creating and maintaining validated fisherfolk identity records for Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro. It supports full profiling, controlled reference-based addressing (barangays), fisherfolk category multi-selection, and media capture (photo and signature). FMS provides fast search and a detailed profile output view so staff can reliably identify and verify fisherfolk during operations. The quality of FMS records directly impacts downstream modules such as Vessel Management System (VMS), permits, catch reporting, and government program tracking. Success means unique, accurate identity records with minimal duplicates, auditable updates, and consistent referencing by other modules.

1) App identity (required)

App Name: Fisherfolk Management System (FMS)

Tagline: “Validated fisherfolk profiling for enterprise operations.”

Primary user value: A single source of truth for fisherfolk identity and profile data used across all fisheries operations modules.

Non-goals (explicitly out of scope):

Managing vessel registration details (owned by VMS)

Permit application/approval workflows (owned by VMS)

Catch/landing reporting entry (owned by VMS)

Program distribution management (owned by VMS)

Public self-service portal for fisherfolk (future)

2) Personas & roles (required)
Personas (human descriptions)

Persona A: Registration Clerk (LGU office staff)
Registers new fisherfolk, validates identity, updates records, prints lists.

Persona B: Field Enumerator (mobile-first)
Captures registrations in the field (photo + signature), needs fast lookup and minimal typing errors.

Persona C: Program Officer / Analyst
Searches profiles, verifies categories, generates summary reports by barangay/category/status.

System roles (for RBAC)

Role: viewer — can search/view fisherfolk list and profile; can view reports; cannot create/edit

Role: user — can create fisherfolk records, upload photo/signature, edit non-critical fields (per rules below)

Role: moderator — can edit critical identity fields, deactivate/reactivate records, resolve duplicates and merge records

Role: admin — full access, manage users/roles, configure reference data, exports, audit logs

Per-entity permission rules (important)

Only moderator/admin can edit critical unique identity fields after creation:

ID Number

Full Name fields (Last/First/Middle)

If you want next: I can generate the matching VMS docs/modules/vms/PRODUCT.md using the same level of detail and ensuring it references FMS strictly by fisherfolkId (no duplicated person fields).

## User

can you add an image reducer or optimizer that can resize the image quality enough to view clearly the images for mobile and PC? because some cameras have a very high resolution. just to be safe from those threats so keep the storage not to get bigger so fast. also apply this optimization on other modules or apps that needs uploading of images

## Assistant

Yes — add this. It’s the right place to control storage growth and prevent giant uploads from slowing down mobile/PC.

Below are exact edits you can paste into your specs:

1) Add to docs/modules/fms/PRODUCT.md — Storage & uploads (Section 10)

Append this under Section 10:

Markdown
### Image optimization & resizing (required)

All uploaded images (photo and signature) must be optimized on upload to reduce storage growth and improve performance on mobile and PC.

Rules:
- Always store an optimized "display" version for UI use.
- Optionally store the original only if needed for compliance/audit; default is NOT to keep original.

Targets:
- Photo (1:1):
  - Create variants:
    - thumb: 128x128 (for list/table thumbnails)
    - display: 512x512 (for profile view)
  - Output format: JPEG or WebP
  - Strip EXIF metadata
  - Use reasonable compression to keep file size small but visually clear

- Signature:
  - Create variants:
    - display: max width 600px (preserve aspect ratio)
  - Output format: PNG (preferred for transparency) or WebP lossless
  - Auto-crop to signed area before optimization

Validation limits:
- Reject images above max file size (e.g., 10MB) and/or extreme dimensions (e.g., > 8000px on any side)
- MIME allowlist remains enforced

Storage:
- Optimized variants are what the app loads by default.
- Store `MediaObject` records per variant (thumb/display/original if enabled).
2) Add to docs/modules/fms/PRODUCT.md — Background jobs (Section 12)

Add a new job:

Markdown
### Job: Optimize uploaded images (photo/signature)

- Trigger: after upload attach event (client notifies API upload complete)
- Inputs: mediaObjectId, type (photo|signature), fisherfolkId
- Steps:
  1) Download uploaded object from MinIO
  2) Validate MIME and dimensions
  3) Apply crop rules (photo 1:1 already, signature crop to ink area if applicable)
  4) Generate required variants (thumb/display)
  5) Upload optimized variants to MinIO with new object keys
  6) Create/Update MediaObject variant records and mark them as active
  7) Optionally delete original if "keepOriginalUploads" is false
- Retries/backoff: yes (e.g., exponential)
- Idempotency key: mediaObjectId + variantName
- Failure handling: mark media as "processing_failed" and show fallback UI
- DLQ + replay needed: yes
3) Add to FMS entities (Section 3) — small update to MediaObject

Update MediaObject fields to support variants:

Markdown
MediaObject additional fields:
- variant (enum: original | display | thumb)
- parentMediaObjectId (nullable; links variants to original)
- purpose (enum: fisherfolk_photo | fisherfolk_signature | other)
- processingStatus (pending | processing | ready | failed)

This makes the system scalable when other modules upload images later.

4) Apply to other modules (Enterprise-level rule)

Add this to docs/PRODUCT.md (Enterprise PRODUCT) under Shared master data or Security/Storage:

Markdown
### Global upload policy: image optimization (required)

Any module that supports image uploads must run server-side image optimization and generate UI-ready variants to prevent oversized uploads from inflating storage and degrading performance.

Default rules:
- Strip EXIF metadata
- Enforce max file size and max pixel dimensions
- Generate at least:
  - thumb variant for lists
  - display variant for viewing
- Prefer WebP/JPEG for photos, PNG/WebP lossless for signatures/doc-like images
- Default UI must load optimized variants, not originals
5) Where this will be used in VMS and future modules

Examples of uploads that should follow the same rule:

Vessel photos

Permit attachments/scans (if you allow images)

Program distribution proof photos

Catch landing proof photos (if added)

So the optimizer job and MediaObject variant model becomes a shared pattern across the ecosystem.

If you want, I can also add a simple configuration block (feature flags) so you can choose per environment:

keep originals in prod (true/false)

compression quality targets

max dimensions
without rewriting the code later.

## User

in 3) Add to FMS entities (Section 3) — small update to MediaObject, i cant find the mediaobject you are refering

## Assistant

Good catch 👍 — the reason you couldn’t find MediaObject might be one of these:

1️⃣ You pasted the Enterprise PRODUCT.md, not the FMS PRODUCT.md
2️⃣ The section you are looking at is collapsed or scrolled past
3️⃣ The text editor search didn’t catch it because it's inside Section 3: Core entities

But the entity does exist in the FMS PRODUCT.md I gave earlier.

Look for this section:

## 3) Core entities & relationships (required)

Inside it you should see:

### Entity: MediaObject (generic upload record)

with fields like:

Fields:
id
bucket
objectKey
mimeType
sizeBytes
checksum
createdByUserId
createdAt

and it is referenced by:

FisherfolkPhoto
FisherfolkSignature
What you need to modify there

Update the MediaObject entity so it supports image variants.

Replace the existing MediaObject section with this improved version.

Entity: MediaObject (generic upload record)
Fields:
id
bucket
objectKey
mimeType
sizeBytes
checksum
variant (original | display | thumb)
purpose (fisherfolk_photo | fisherfolk_signature | other)
parentMediaObjectId (nullable reference to MediaObject.id)
processingStatus (pending | processing | ready | failed)
createdByUserId
createdAt

Relationships:
referenced by FisherfolkPhoto
referenced by FisherfolkSignature

Constraints:
index(bucket)
unique(bucket, objectKey)
index(parentMediaObjectId)
Why this is important (future-proofing)

This small change allows the system to support multiple optimized versions of the same upload.

Example for one fisherfolk photo:

variant	size	purpose
original	8MB	optional storage
display	512px	profile page
thumb	128px	search list

Your UI then loads:

thumb → table views
display → profile view

and never loads the original.

This keeps:

page loads fast

storage growth controlled

mobile performance good

Example storage structure in MinIO
fms-fisherfolk-photos/
   fisherfolkId/
      original.jpg
      display.webp
      thumb.webp
Very important architectural note

This MediaObject system becomes the universal upload model across your enterprise.

Later modules will reuse it:

Module	Upload
FMS	fisherfolk photo, signature
VMS	vessel photo
Permits	scanned permits
Programs	distribution proof photos
Catch	landing proof photos

So designing this properly now avoids redesign later.

If you want, I can also show you a very clean enterprise upload architecture that will make your system support images, PDFs, and future documents without redesigning the database.

- the barangay display format in the fisherfolk profile view display of fisherfolks or in any app would be, "Brgy. { name of barangay }, City of Calapan"
- add an ID printing sub-menu feature in FMS app wherein I can search for names of fisherfolks and multi select them ( max of 4 records ) to layout a front and back ID format and layout it a 200x300mm size portrait paper
- the design should be editable later
- in addition to the governance of this enterprise ecosystem we are making, i would like to add a level of tenancy wherein for every municipality or LGU, they can have the access of their own set of modules of apps like FMS and VMS that we already planned.
- there is only 1 main top level entity user that can see and manage all municipality or LGU level apps or modules
- so the access levels per set of users would be i think is like this diagram if will be based on PRODUCT.md:
MAIN PRODUCT.md
|_LGU
   |_fms
       |_PRODUCT.md
   |_vms
       |_PRODUCT.md
- can you say that you understand what i mean here?

## Assistant

Saved ✅ (barangay fixed list + display format + ID printing submenu + editable template requirement + LGU tenancy model + global super-admin concept).

And yes — I understand exactly what you mean with your tenancy diagram.

What you mean (in plain terms)

You want the enterprise ecosystem to become multi-LGU / multi-municipality.

Each LGU (tenant) has its own isolated dataset (their own fisherfolk, vessels, permits, reports, etc.).

Inside each LGU, they can enable/use a set of modules (like FMS, VMS).

There is exactly one top-level global role/user (Super Admin) that can see/manage all LGUs and their module access/configuration.

Regular users belong to one LGU and can only access that LGU’s data and enabled modules.

That maps cleanly to your structure idea:

MAIN PRODUCT.md
  └─ LGU (tenant)
       ├─ fms (module)
       └─ vms (module)
How this should appear in PRODUCT.md (recommended wording)

In your Enterprise docs/PRODUCT.md:

Set Tenancy mode: multi

Define:

LGU as the tenant entity

tenantId is required on all tenant-owned records

“Global admin scope” = global admin + tenant admins (optional)

Module access can be per-LGU via an LGUModule enablement table (or config)

In FMS/VMS module PRODUCT.md:

Add a rule: every record is scoped by tenantId/LGUId

Barangays list is the fixed Calapan list (for now), but tenancy implies this could become “per LGU config” later if you expand beyond Calapan.

If you want next, I can write the exact Enterprise Tenancy section you should paste into docs/PRODUCT.md (including entities like LGU, LGUModule, UserLGURole, and the isolation rules) without changing your existing module specs too much.
