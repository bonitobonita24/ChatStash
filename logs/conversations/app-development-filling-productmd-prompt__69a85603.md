## Assistant

Since you’re using a Spec-Driven AI Development workflow, the quality of PRODUCT.md directly determines how good your generated architecture, schema, API, and UI will be.

The prompt you showed is already excellent, but the key challenge is:

How do I fill this if the product idea is still vague?

Below is a structured way to answer each section so Copilot/AI agents can reason correctly when generating your system.

How to Fill the PRODUCT.md Prompt Properly
0) One-paragraph summary

Goal: Describe the product at a high level.

Write:

What the product is

Who it is for

What the main activity is

What success looks like

Example (for your Arena social app idea)
Markdown
Countdown Arena is a social media platform where users participate in time-based competitive challenges called Arenas. Each Arena has a theme, a countdown entry phase, and a voting phase where the community decides the winner. The platform is designed for creators and casual users who enjoy competitive content creation and discovery through a TikTok-style entertainment feed. Users can join Arenas, submit entries, vote on others, and browse past or ongoing competitions. Success means high user participation, engaging voting interactions, and a constantly refreshing feed of competitive content.

Think product pitch, not technical description.

1) App identity
App Name

Your product name.

Example:

Countdown Arena
Tagline

Short marketing line.

Examples:

"Compete. Create. Win."

or

"Where the internet battles."
Primary user value

What users gain from using the app.

Example:

Users can join themed creative competitions, showcase their content, and compete for community recognition through voting.
Non-goals

This section is very important for AI agents.

It tells the system what NOT to build.

Example:

- Not a traditional messaging platform
- Not a marketplace
- Not a professional portfolio platform
- Not a long-form content publishing platform

This prevents feature creep in generated code.

2) Personas & roles
Personas (human descriptions)

These are behavioral users, not technical roles.

Example:

Persona A — Casual Viewer
A user who scrolls the feed to watch competitions and vote but rarely participates.
Persona B — Creator Competitor
A user who frequently joins Arenas and uploads entries to compete and gain recognition.
Persona C — Community Moderator
A trusted user responsible for reviewing reported entries and enforcing platform rules.
System roles (RBAC)

These are technical permissions.

Example:

viewer — can browse public arenas and entries but cannot vote or submit

user — can create profile, join arenas, submit entries, vote, comment

moderator — can remove entries, ban users, resolve reports

admin — full platform control including user management and arena creation
3) Core entities & relationships

This section is CRITICAL because it becomes:

Prisma schema

Database tables

NestJS services

API endpoints

Entity: User

Example:

Fields:
id
email
displayName
avatarUrl
bio
status
role
createdAt
updatedAt

Relationships:

hasMany entries
hasMany votes
hasMany comments
hasMany notifications
Entity: Arena
Fields:
id
title
description
theme
status (entry_open | voting | closed)
entryDeadline
votingDeadline
createdBy
createdAt

Relationships:

hasMany entries
belongsTo creator (User)
Entity: Entry
Fields:
id
arenaId
userId
mediaUrl
caption
createdAt

Relationships:

belongsTo arena
belongsTo user
hasMany votes
Entity: Vote
Fields:
id
entryId
userId
createdAt

Constraints:

unique(userId, entryId)
Entity: Comment
Fields:
id
entryId
userId
text
createdAt

This section helps AI generate:

Prisma models

NestJS modules

validation schemas

4) Primary workflows

This becomes:

API endpoints

service logic

UI flows

Workflow A — Join Arena and Submit Entry
1) User opens Arena page
2) System checks arena status = entry_open
3) User uploads media
4) System validates file type and size
5) System stores entry record
6) Entry appears in arena feed
Workflow B — Vote on Entries
1) User opens voting feed
2) System loads entries for active arena
3) User votes on an entry
4) System validates user hasn't voted on that entry
5) Vote stored in database
6) Vote count updates
Workflow C — Discover Arenas
1) User opens home feed
2) System loads trending arenas and entries
3) User scrolls vertically
4) System loads more entries via cursor pagination
5) Screens & navigation

This becomes Next.js routes.

Public screens
/
Landing page

/auth/login

/auth/callback
App screens
/feed

/arena/[arenaId]

/entry/[entryId]

/profile/[username]

/submit-entry
Admin screens
/admin

/admin/arenas

/admin/users

/admin/reports
6) API expectations

Your stack suggests:

NestJS

REST

Versioned API

Example:

API base path: /api/v1

Response format:
{
  code,
  message,
  requestId,
  data,
  error
}

Pagination:
cursor-based
7) Authentication & authorization

Since you're using Keycloak, define:

Keycloak realm name: arena-platform
Login method
email/password
future: Google login
JWT claims mapping

Example:

userId → sub
roles → realm_access.roles
tenantId → none (single tenant)
8) Tenancy model

Your app likely:

Tenancy mode: single

Future SaaS possibility:

future multi-tenant via row partition
9) Data sensitivity

For social apps:

Contains PII: yes
(email, username, profile info)

Example policies:

Retention: indefinite unless user deletes
Right-to-delete: yes
Data export: yes

Audit logs:

login
account deletion
role change
content deletion
10) Storage & uploads

Your app requires media.

Example:

Upload types: images, video
Max size: 50MB
MIME: image/jpeg, image/png, video/mp4

Objects:

Public objects: entries
Private objects: avatars (optional)

Buckets:

avatars
entries
thumbnails
11) Realtime requirements

Example:

Features:
live vote counts
arena countdown timers

Transport:

WebSockets
12) Background jobs

BullMQ examples:

Job: Close Arena Entry Phase

Trigger:

entryDeadline reached

Steps:

1) mark arena status = voting
2) notify participants
Job: Close Voting Phase
1) calculate winners
2) update leaderboard
3) notify participants
13) Notifications

Example:

Email: yes (welcome, password reset)
In-app: yes
Push: later

Triggers:

new arena
entry receives votes
arena results announced
14) Performance & scale

Even rough numbers help AI:

Example:

Expected DAU: 50k
Peak RPS: 500
Uploads/day: 10k
DB size: 1TB long-term
15) Environments

Example:

dev
stage
prod

Local:

web: http://localhost:3000
api: http://localhost:3001
16) Observability

Your stack already includes:

Logs: pino
Metrics: Prometheus
Tracing: OpenTelemetry (later)
17) Security

Example:

CORS: restricted
CSRF: yes
Rate limit: 100 req/min per user

Admin protection:

role = admin only
18) Acceptance criteria

These become system validation checks.

Example:

User can create account
User can join arena
User can submit entry
User can vote
Voting results computed correctly
Admin can moderate content
19) Open questions

Leave unresolved items:

Should arenas allow multiple entries?
Should voting be anonymous?
Should there be rewards?

These guide Copilot Discovery Phase.

Critical Tip for Your Spec-Driven Workflow

Your PRODUCT.md must avoid implementation details like:

❌ don't write:

use prisma
use redis
use nextjs

Because those are already defined in your architecture spec.

PRODUCT.md should describe:

product behavior

entities

workflows

rules

If you want, I can also generate a FULL completed PRODUCT.md for your Countdown Arena app that is perfectly optimized for your Spec-Driven AI development system (Next.js + NestJS + Prisma + Keycloak + BullMQ + MinIO).

That will save you hours of architecture iteration.

## User

- no, what I'm about to build is not for Countdown Arena.
- I'm want to build a Fisherfolk Management System
- Full fisherfolk profiling + operations
- Registration, livelihoods, vessels, permits, catch monitoring, reporting
- Registration data includes:
1. ID Number ( manual input, must be unique )
2. Full Name ( Last Name, First Name, Middle Name, must be unique, no multiple ID can be in one full name )
3. Date of Birth (MM/DD/YYYY)
4. Address (Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro ready selection of barangays)
5. Sex ( Selection of Male or Female)
6. Image ( Upload or via webcam/phone camera options with auto crop to 1x1 ratio)
7. Signature ( Upload or via stylus pen drawing options auto cropping to signed image area )
8. RSBSA Number ( manual input, must be unique )
9. Contact number ( Manual input, must be saved with +63 prefix then starts with number 9 to be filled )
10. Fisherfolk Category type Selection ( can multi-select ): 
a. Boat Owner/Operator
b. Capture Fishing
c. Gleaning
d. Vendor
e. Fish Processing
f. Aquaculture
11. Is President? ( Just a clickable check box, if clicked/checked means that the currently registering fisherfolk is a President in his barangay based on the address selected )

- this Fisherfolk Management System is just a module/app which will a part of a bigger system or an enterprise system
- I just want to start from this app because this is the foundation and first entry of data that will be used in the next app or module inside the enterprise system
- another module or app is Vessel registration, type, tonnage, licensing, Fishing Gears - Gear types, quantities, associations, Permits & Licenses
- Permits, renewal tracking, Programs / Interventions - Government programs, beneficiaries, distribution, Catch / Harvest records - Species, volume, landing sites, dates

## Assistant

Got it — you’re building a Fisherfolk Management System (FMS) module that becomes the master data foundation for a larger enterprise platform. Below is a ready-to-paste PRODUCT.md content (fill-in style but already concrete), optimized for spec-driven generation.

0) One-paragraph summary (required)

The Fisherfolk Management System (FMS) is a government operations module for managing complete fisherfolk profiles and field operations data in Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro. It supports registration and identity capture (photo + signature), categorization by livelihood types, and links each fisherfolk to vessels, gears, permits, programs, and catch/harvest monitoring. The system is intended for LGU/agency staff, field enumerators, and administrators who need reliable, searchable records, compliance tracking, and reporting. Success means high-quality unique profiles, fast lookup, minimal duplicates, traceable updates, and accurate operational reports usable by downstream enterprise modules.

1) App identity (required)

App Name: Fisherfolk Management System (FMS)

Tagline: “Unified fisherfolk profiling and operations tracking.”

Primary user value: Centralized, validated fisherfolk master records that connect to vessels, permits, programs, and catch monitoring for compliance and reporting.

Non-goals (explicitly out of scope):

Full accounting/financial management

Public-facing social/community features

E-commerce marketplace

GIS-grade vessel tracking (future module)

National registry synchronization (future; unless explicitly required)

2) Personas & roles (required)
Personas (human descriptions)

Persona A: Registration Clerk (City Hall staff)
Registers fisherfolk, verifies documents, edits records, prints/export lists.

Persona B: Field Enumerator (mobile-first user)
Captures registrations on-site (photo/signature), later syncs, needs fast search.

Persona C: Program Officer / Analyst
Generates reports, monitors beneficiaries, checks permit renewal status and catch summaries.

System roles (for RBAC)

Role: viewer — can search and view fisherfolk profiles and reports; no create/edit/delete

Role: user — can create profiles, edit allowed fields, attach media (photo/signature), create operational records (catch/program entries) based on permissions

Role: moderator — can resolve duplicates, approve merges, correct critical identity fields, manage barangay reference data (if allowed)

Role: admin — full access, manage users/roles, system configuration, audit logs, export controls

Per-entity rules (important):

user cannot delete fisherfolk profiles; only moderator/admin

Only moderator/admin can edit unique identity fields (ID Number, Full Name, RSBSA Number) after initial creation (or require approval workflow)

Only admin can perform bulk imports/exports (if enabled)

3) Core entities & relationships (required)

Required events: create/update/delete, merge, role changes, exports

(Future module entities can be listed now as “planned” to influence architecture without implementing immediately.)

4) Primary workflows (required, step-by-step)
Workflow A: Register fisherfolk profile (clerk/enumerator)

User opens “New Registration”

System shows form + barangay selection list (Calapan City only)

User inputs ID Number, full name parts, DOB, sex, address barangay, RSBSA, contact number

User selects one or more fisherfolk categories

User checks “Is President?” if applicable

User captures photo (upload or camera) → system enforces 1:1 crop

User captures signature (upload or draw) → system crops to signed area

System validates uniqueness: idNumber, rsbsaNumber, fullNameNormalized

System stores Fisherfolk + joins + media objects

System responds with created profile + printable/view page

Workflow B: Search & view fisherfolk profile

User searches by ID Number / name / RSBSA / barangay

System returns paginated results with key identity fields and status

User opens profile view with linked operational records (empty if none)

Workflow C: Update fisherfolk profile

User opens profile → Edit

System enforces field-level permissions (unique identity fields gated)

System validates changes (including uniqueness if edited)

System saves update + writes AuditLog

Workflow D: Deactivate record (soft delete)

Moderator/Admin selects “Deactivate” with reason

System marks status + locks new operational entries if required

AuditLog recorded

Workflow E: Resolve duplicates (merge)

Moderator searches suspected duplicates

System compares identity fields + shows merge preview

Moderator chooses “primary record” and merges

System re-links all foreign keys to primary record

System archives secondary record + logs merge event

5) Screens & navigation (recommended)
Public screens

/: redirect to login or app (depending on auth)

/auth/login

/auth/callback

App screens (authenticated)

/dashboard: summary counts (registered today, by barangay, by category)

/fisherfolk: list + filters (barangay, category, status)

/fisherfolk/new: registration form + photo/signature capture

/fisherfolk/[id]: profile view (tabs: Profile, Vessels, Permits, Programs, Catch, Audit)

/fisherfolk/[id]/edit

/reports: predefined reports exportable

/settings/profile: user profile

Admin screens (role-gated)

/admin

/admin/users

/admin/roles

/admin/reference/barangays

/admin/reference/categories

/admin/audit-logs

/admin/import-export (if enabled)

6) API expectations (recommended)

API base path: /api/v1

Response envelope: { code, message, requestId, data, error }

Pagination: cursor-based for lists

Filtering/sorting:

?q= for search

?barangayId=

?categoryId=

?status=

tenantId: none (single tenant for now)

RBAC rules

viewer: read-only

user: create/edit non-critical fields, add operational records

moderator: merge, deactivate, edit critical fields, resolve reports

admin: everything + user/role management + exports + reference data

8) Tenancy model (required)

Tenancy mode: single (module within a larger enterprise system)

Future-ready note: if multi-tenant later, prefer row partition (tenantId column) with strict isolation on fisherfolk and operational records.

9) Data sensitivity & governance (required)

Contains PII? yes (name, DOB, address, contact, photo, signature)

Data retention policy: retain while active + per LGU policy; soft-delete only

Data export requirement: yes (CSV/PDF reports)

Right-to-delete requirement: likely yes (but may be constrained by government record policies)

Audit log required events:

login (optional)

create/update fisherfolk

critical field changes (ID/name/RSBSA)

exports

role changes

10) Storage & uploads (required)

Upload types: images

Max file size: (recommend) 5–10MB per image

Allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp

Virus scanning required? later (recommended)

Public or private objects? private

Object lifecycle rules: delete objects only when record is permanently removed (if allowed)

Buckets needed:

fisherfolk-photos

fisherfolk-signatures

Upload workflow (presigned S3)

Client requests presign (type=photo|signature, fisherfolkId optional)

API validates size/type and returns { uploadUrl, objectKey }

Client uploads to MinIO

Client calls API to attach object to fisherfolk record

API generates derived versions if needed (thumbnail, normalized crop)

11) Realtime requirements (optional)

Not required for v1. (Optional later: live “registration count today”, but can be polling.)

12) Background jobs & async workflows (required if any)
Job: Generate report exports

Trigger: user requests export

Inputs: filters, format

Steps: query DB → generate file → store in object storage → notify user

Idempotency key: exportRequestId

Failure handling: mark failed + allow retry

DLQ + replay: yes

Job: Permit renewal reminders (future module)

Trigger: daily scheduled

Inputs: permits expiring in X days

Steps: create notifications

Scheduled: yes (daily)

13) Notifications (optional)

Email: no (v1), later optional

In-app: yes (exports ready, permit renewals later)

Push: later

14) Performance & scale (recommended)

Expected DAU/MAU: 20–200 staff users (typical LGU) + growth for enterprise usage

Peak requests/sec: low (<50 rps) but must be reliable

Upload volume/day: 50–500 images/day (depends on registrations)

DB size: grows steadily; must support years of historical operational data

15) Environments & domains (required)

Environments: dev / stage / prod

Domain/base URL:

stage: TBD

prod: TBD

Local dev URLs:

web: http://localhost:3000

api: http://localhost:3001

16) Observability requirements (recommended)

Logs: JSON in prod, pretty in dev: yes

Metrics: Prometheus: yes (optional in v1)

Tracing: OpenTelemetry: later

Health endpoints:

liveness

readiness

17) Security requirements (required)

CORS policy: allow only approved web origins

CSRF: yes (if cookie-based session); if pure JWT header auth, document approach

Rate limiting: e.g. 60 req/min/user; stricter on auth + upload presign endpoints

Admin endpoint protections: admin role only + audit logs

Allowed origins: stage/prod domains + localhost dev

Secrets handling: env-only yes

18) Acceptance criteria (required)

User can login/logout successfully via Keycloak

User can register fisherfolk profile end-to-end (including photo + signature)

Uniqueness enforcement works (ID Number, full name, RSBSA)

Contact number stored as +63 format and validated

Barangay selection list is available and restricted to Calapan City

Fisherfolk category multi-select is saved correctly

Search works (ID/name/RSBSA/barangay) with pagination

Audit logs record create/update/merge/deactivate actions

Upload works via presigned URLs and objects are private

CI passes and compose brings infra online

Health endpoints return OK

Governance guard blocks unsynced spec changes

19) Open questions (optional)

Should “Full Name uniqueness” be strict exact match, or normalized (case/spacing)?

Do we support suffixes (Jr., Sr.) and multiple middle names?

Should DOB be required or optional (some registrations may not know exact DOB)?

Should photo/signature be mandatory for registration, or optional with “pending” status?

Should offline-first mobile capture be required for field enumeration?

Are exports allowed for all roles, or admin-only?

If you want, I can also rewrite this into an even more “agent-friendly” format by:

defining exact validation regex for PH contact numbers,

specifying merge conflict rules for duplicates,

and listing future module entity stubs (Vessel, Gear, Permit, Catch, Program) so your downstream modules plug in cleanly without schema refactors.

## User

add an output view display Profile of fisherfolk's Data record if name or ID is selected or opened in searching or list view of fisherfolks

## Assistant

Good addition 👍 — this should be reflected in two places in your PRODUCT.md so the AI agents correctly generate:

a profile page UI

a GET profile API endpoint

the data aggregation logic

Below is the exact section you should add/update.

1️⃣ Update Section 4 — Primary Workflows

Add this workflow.

media

✅ UI profile layout

photo

identity

categories

signature

future module sections

💡 Pro tip for your enterprise plan

Add a Profile Sidebar Summary Card that always stays visible:

Photo
Name
ID Number
Barangay
Categories
President Badge

Then the rest of the profile becomes scrollable operational sections (vessels, permits, catch etc.).

This pattern works extremely well for government registry systems.

If you want, I can also show you 3 extremely important database design improvements for this fisherfolk system that will prevent duplicate identity records and corruption later (this is a common problem in LGU registry systems).

## User

yes please do

## Assistant

Here are 3 database design improvements that will save you from the most common LGU registry problems: duplicate people, corrupted identity, and “can’t merge later” records. These are practical, and they fit your stack (Prisma + Postgres).

1) Use a normalized “Identity Fingerprint” to enforce real name uniqueness

Your rule is: no multiple ID can be in one full name (i.e., one person record per full name).
But “full name” comparisons break easily because of:

casing (juan dela cruz vs JUAN DELA CRUZ)

extra spaces (DELA CRUZ)

punctuation (Dela-Cruz)

missing middle name / “N/A”

diacritics (rare, but happens)

What to do

Store both:

raw name fields (what user typed)

a generated normalized field used for uniqueness + search

Add fields

fullNameDisplay (computed or stored)

fullNameNormalized (stored, indexed, unique)

Normalization rules (recommended)

uppercase

trim

collapse multiple spaces to one

remove punctuation (.,-')

middle name: treat empty / “N/A” consistently

DB rule

unique(fullNameNormalized)

✅ Result: you enforce your “one person per name” rule reliably.

2) Separate “Citizen Identity” from “Operational Person Record” (future-proofing)

Since this module is the foundation for a bigger enterprise system, you want to avoid this trap:

Future modules create duplicates because each module saves identity fields again.

What to do

Create a stable core entity (person identity) and let modules reference it.

Option A (simple now): keep Fisherfolk as the core person record
and ensure every future module references fisherfolkId only.

Option B (best for enterprise): create a Person table now, and FisherfolkProfile extends it.

Person: name, DOB, sex, contact, address, photo/signature

FisherfolkProfile: fisherfolk categories, RSBSA, president flag, domain-specific fields

✅ Result: if later you add “Farmer”, “Vendor”, “Beneficiary”, etc., it’s the same person with multiple profiles, not duplicates.

If you don’t want complexity yet, do Option A but name your Fisherfolk fields as “person-ish” and keep it clean.

3) Build duplicate handling into the model: soft-delete + merge lineage + immutable IDs

In real deployments, duplicates are inevitable:

someone registers twice

spelling differs slightly

clerk makes a new record instead of searching

If you don’t design for merges early, your database gets stuck.

What to do (minimum)

Soft-delete + merge metadata

Add fields to Fisherfolk:

status (active|inactive|merged|deceased|moved)

mergedIntoId (nullable FK → Fisherfolk.id)

mergeReason (text)

mergedAt (datetime)

Merge rule

If record is merged, it becomes read-only

All future references should resolve to the “primary” record:

when fetching a record, if mergedIntoId exists, redirect to that profile

✅ Result: you can safely merge records later without breaking foreign keys.

Bonus: Immutable identity keys

Never allow normal users to edit:

idNumber

rsbsaNumber

fullNameNormalized

Only moderator/admin (and log it in AuditLog).

Suggested Prisma/DB constraints summary (copy into PRODUCT.md)

Put this under Entity: Fisherfolk → Constraints

idNumber unique

rsbsaNumber unique

fullNameNormalized unique (generated from name parts)

contactNumberE164 validated to +63 + 9xxxxxxxxx

mergedIntoId nullable FK; when not null, status must be merged

indexes:

barangayId

status

fullNameNormalized

idNumber, rsbsaNumber

One more extremely practical tip (PH LGU reality)

Many people share the same exact full name. Your strict rule “one full name = one person” will eventually block valid registrations.

A safer rule is:

Unique: idNumber and/or rsbsaNumber

Name uniqueness becomes “warn + review”, not hard-block

If your policy truly requires name uniqueness, keep it — but expect false positives.

If you want, I can give you a merge workflow spec (UI + API + DB steps) that’s safe and audit-able, and works even after you add the Vessel/Permit/Catch modules.

## User

- ok that's a good offer, please save that.
- before we do that i also want to add another app or a module that is dependent to FMS
- i want this to be an independent module thou is relies on FMO app as boat owner because they tend to manage vessels information too.
- Register vessels, link to owner, renewal cycle, Permit application workflow - Apply, review, approve, print permits, Catch reporting / fish landing - Log catches per landing site/trip with species & volume, Program enrollment & distribution - Create programs, enroll beneficiaries, track distribution, Reporting & analytics dashboard
- please gather pertinent data needed for this for i dont have specifics of the data needed but the idea is there already
- for now we have 2 modules or apps already as part of the enterprise ecosystem
- every app or modules we build must in a modern left side menu following it sub menus to offer per apps or modules
- our main dashboard will be latest charts of possible reports that you can imagine that is related to this project

## Assistant

Saved. ✅ (The 3 DB improvements + merge/lineage approach are now in memory for this project.)

Now, for your 2nd module/app (dependent on FMS but independently deployable), here’s a pertinent data blueprint you can drop into a new PRODUCT.md later, even if you don’t know every detail yet.

Module 2: Vessel, Permits, Catch, Programs, Reporting
Suggested module name

Fisherfolk Operations Module (FOM)
(Depends on FMS for “owner” identity, but can run as its own app/module.)

Dependency rule

A Vessel Owner must reference an existing FMS Fisherfolk record.

If an owner isn’t found, user is redirected to FMS registration (or shown “create new fisherfolk” link if integrated).

A) Core Entities You’ll Need
1) Vessel

Purpose: Register boats and link to owner(s).

Fields (recommended):

id

registrationNumber (unique; may be LGU-issued)

name (optional)

ownerFisherfolkId (FK → FMS Fisherfolk)

barangayId (redundant copy for reporting speed; still source-of-truth is owner address)

vesselType (motorized | non-motorized | outrigger | etc.)

hullMaterial (wood | fiberglass | aluminum | other)

lengthM, widthM, grossTonnage (optional but useful)

engineType (inboard/outboard/none), engineHp (optional)

homePort / landingSiteDefaultId (optional)

notes

B) Primary Workflows (for spec-driven generation)
Workflow 1: Register vessel + link owner

User opens Vessels → New

System searches/selects owner from FMS (by ID/Name)

User encodes vessel details

System validates unique registrationNumber

System saves vessel and shows vessel profile page

Workflow 2: Permit application (apply → review → approve → print)

Staff creates application (select permit type + applicant + vessel if required)

Submit for review

Reviewer checks requirements, sets under_review → approved/rejected

On approval, system generates validFrom/validTo based on permitType validity

Print permit: generate PDF, store in MinIO, mark printed, assign documentNo

Permit becomes visible in vessel/profile history

Workflow 3: Renewal tracking

System lists permits expiring in N days

Staff triggers renewal (clone application + update dates)

Notifications or dashboard cards show due renewals

Workflow 4: Catch reporting / fish landing

User selects fisherfolk and vessel (optional)

Select landing site + date/time

Add multiple species items and weights

Save report

Dashboard aggregates totals by date/site/species/barangay

Workflow 5: Program enrollment & distribution

Admin creates program

Staff enrolls beneficiaries (from FMS)

Staff records distributions with item + qty per beneficiary

Reports show coverage, totals distributed, beneficiaries per barangay/category

C) Left-side Menu Requirement (Modern Admin UI)

You said: every module/app must have a modern left-side menu with submenus.

Enterprise Shell (top-level)

Dashboard

This structure also maps cleanly to Next.js routes.

D) Main Dashboard: “Latest charts you can imagine”

Here are high-value charts/cards that fit your data and feel “modern”:

Quick KPI cards

Beneficiaries by program (bar chart)

Registrations by barangay (bar chart)

Tables

Latest catch reports (most recent)

Permits due for renewal (sorted by soonest expiry)

Recent registrations / edits (audit-driven)

Next step (no waiting): I can “save” this module blueprint too

If you want me to store it as well (like we did earlier), tell me and I’ll save:

module name + dependency rule

entity list (Vessel/Permit/Catch/Program)

left-menu IA

dashboard chart set

Also: when you’re ready, I can convert this into a clean PRODUCT.md for Module 2 that matches your spec-driven pipeline exactly.

## User

- ok do it but please change first the Suggested module name to Vessel Management System (FMS), we will be using that name on our next module later
- just to clarify your thoughts "dependent on FMS but independently deployable", yes its dependent on FMS and independent app but not deployable if your saying that it will be deployed later or separately to the server. Save this thought, " all of our modules or apps that we are going to build in this enterprise ecosystem will be viewed as menus in a large workspace, with sub menus when selected to show specific available operations per menu and those menus will have its own permissions if a user level is granted to access or not

## Assistant

Done — updated and saved. ✅

Changes applied

Suggested module name is now: Vessel Management System (VMS) (instead of Fisherfolk Operations Module).

Saved your clarification that “independent app” means logically separate module, but not necessarily separately deployed. In your ecosystem, modules are menus inside one workspace.

Saved the enterprise UX/RBAC rule: each module/menu (and its submenus) has its own permissions; users only see/enter modules they’re granted.

What I saved (so we can reuse later)

VMS blueprint: core entities (Vessel, Ownership History, Permit Types, Permit Application workflow, Permit Documents, Landing Sites, Species, Catch Reports + items, Programs + enrollments + distributions)

Module dependency rule: VMS relies on FMS fisherfolk records for owners/applicants/beneficiaries

Workspace navigation IA: left-side menu with submenus per module

Dashboard chart ideas: KPIs + catch/permit/program analytics

Whenever you’re ready, tell me “generate VMS PRODUCT.md”, and I’ll output a complete PRODUCT.md for the Vessel Management System (VMS) that matches your spec-driven format and your workspace/menu permission model.

## User

so how about the first module we built? the FMS? will it be also included in the PRODUCT.md?

## Assistant

Yes — and this is very important for your Spec-Driven architecture.

Short answer:

Yes, the Fisherfolk Management System (FMS) must have its own PRODUCT.md.

But the enterprise platform itself should also have a top-level PRODUCT.md describing the whole ecosystem and modules.

So you will have 2 levels of PRODUCT.md.

1️⃣ Level 1 — Enterprise PRODUCT.md (Workspace level)

This describes the entire ecosystem, not the details of each module.

Purpose:

Define the workspace

Define modules

Define shared identity

Define global navigation

Define RBAC model

Example structure:

docs/
 ├─ PRODUCT.md              ← Enterprise platform
 ├─ modules/
 │   ├─ fms/
 │   │   └─ PRODUCT.md      ← Fisherfolk Management System
 │   ├─ vms/
 │   │   └─ PRODUCT.md      ← Vessel Management System
Example Enterprise PRODUCT.md
Summary

The system is an enterprise fisheries management platform used by LGUs to manage fisherfolk registration, vessel records, permits, catch monitoring, and government program interventions. The platform is composed of multiple operational modules that share a unified workspace and authentication system. Each module provides domain-specific tools but relies on shared master data such as fisherfolk identities. Users access modules through a left-side workspace menu, and permissions determine which modules and operations are visible.

Modules
Module	Purpose
FMS	Fisherfolk master data registry
VMS	Vessel registration and permits
Catch Monitoring (future)	Fisheries production monitoring
Programs & Interventions (future)	Government support programs
Analytics	Reporting and dashboards

Shared Master Data

The system uses shared master data across modules.

Primary master entities:

Fisherfolk (FMS)
Barangay
Species
Landing Sites
Permit Types
Gear Types

Example dependency:

VMS → requires Fisherfolk from FMS
Catch Monitoring → requires Vessel from VMS
Programs → requires Fisherfolk from FMS
RBAC Model

Roles apply across modules, but permissions are module-scoped.

Example:

Role	Access
viewer	read-only
user	operational actions
moderator	data correction + merge
admin	full system

Permissions example:

FMS.create_fisherfolk
FMS.edit_fisherfolk
VMS.create_vessel
VMS.approve_permit
PROGRAMS.manage
ADMIN.users
2️⃣ Level 2 — Module PRODUCT.md (FMS / VMS)

Each module has its own detailed spec.

Example:

modules/fms/PRODUCT.md

This contains:

Fisherfolk entity

Registration workflow

Photo + signature upload

Duplicate detection

Profile display

Reports

And

modules/vms/PRODUCT.md

Contains:

Vessel entity

Permit workflow

Catch reports

Programs

dashboards

3️⃣ Why this matters for AI Spec-Driven Development

This structure lets your AI agents understand:

Enterprise level

system architecture

module relationships

navigation structure

Module level

entities

APIs

workflows

UI pages

Without this separation, AI agents often:

mix entities

generate wrong dependencies

duplicate models

4️⃣ Final architecture recommendation

Your repo structure should look like this:

docs/
   PRODUCT.md                 ← Enterprise system

modules/
   fms/
      PRODUCT.md              ← Fisherfolk Management System

   vms/
      PRODUCT.md              ← Vessel Management System

apps/
   web/
   api/

packages/
   db
   ui

This structure works perfectly with your pnpm + turbo monorepo + spec-driven pipeline.

5️⃣ One more thing you should define early (very important)

Because your system is LGU operations software, the enterprise PRODUCT.md should also define:

Geographic scope
City: Calapan City
Province: Oriental Mindoro
Barangays: predefined list

This helps the system generate:

dropdown lists

report filters

geographic aggregations

✅ If you want, I can also generate a complete Enterprise PRODUCT.md for your ecosystem that includes:

workspace architecture

module dependencies

RBAC permission matrix

dashboard analytics model

data governance rules

It will make your AI-generated architecture much cleaner and more scalable.

## User

yes sure, i like your plan and it sounds like plan now. lets do it

## Assistant

Great. Let’s establish the Enterprise PRODUCT.md now.
This will become the root product specification that your AI Spec-Driven system uses to understand the whole ecosystem, while each module (FMS, VMS, etc.) will have its own detailed PRODUCT.md.

Below is a clean, ready-to-use Enterprise PRODUCT.md tailored to everything you described.

Enterprise PRODUCT.md

(Root spec for the Fisheries Management Enterprise System)

0) One-paragraph summary

The Fisheries Management Enterprise System is a government operations platform designed to manage fisherfolk registration, vessel records, permits, catch monitoring, and program interventions within Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro. The platform is organized into multiple domain modules such as the Fisherfolk Management System (FMS) and Vessel Management System (VMS), which operate within a unified workspace and share common master data. Each module provides specialized operational capabilities while relying on shared identity and reference data to maintain consistency across the ecosystem. The system is used by LGU staff, field enumerators, program officers, and administrators to maintain accurate fisheries data, track compliance, manage permits, and generate analytical reports for policy and planning.

1) App identity

Platform Name: Fisheries Management Enterprise System

Tagline:
Unified fisheries data, compliance, and operations management.

Primary user value

The platform provides a centralized operational workspace where LGU staff can register fisherfolk, manage vessels and permits, record catch data, administer government programs, and generate analytics for fisheries governance.

Non-goals

The platform is NOT intended to provide:

public social networking

online seafood marketplaces

financial accounting systems

GPS vessel tracking (possible future system)

national-level fisheries registry synchronization (future integration)

2) Ecosystem architecture

The platform is composed of independent functional modules that operate inside a single enterprise workspace.

Modules are logically independent but share common infrastructure and master data.

Modules appear as menus within a unified application interface.

Users access modules based on role permissions.

3) Current modules
Fisherfolk Management System (FMS)

Purpose:

Maintain the master registry of fisherfolk identities.

Core functions:

fisherfolk registration

profile management

identity verification

fisherfolk categorization

photo & signature capture

fisherfolk search and lookup

reporting

Dependencies:

This module acts as master data for other modules.

Vessel Management System (VMS)

Purpose:

Manage vessel registration, permit applications, catch reporting, and fisheries operational records.

Core functions:

vessel registration

owner linking (to FMS)

permit application workflow

permit approval and printing

permit renewal tracking

catch / fish landing reports

government program enrollment

beneficiary distribution tracking

analytics dashboards

Dependencies:

Requires fisherfolk identity records from FMS.

4) Future modules (planned)

These may later be separated but are conceptually part of the ecosystem.

Catch Monitoring & Fisheries Production

catch analytics

species monitoring

production trends

landing site reporting

Programs & Interventions

livelihood programs

equipment distributions

fisherfolk training programs

beneficiary tracking

Analytics & Reporting

system dashboards

fisheries policy analytics

LGU reporting

5) Workspace navigation model

The system uses a modern left-side workspace navigation.

Menus represent modules.

Each module expands into submenus representing operations.

Example navigation:

Dashboard

Fisherfolk Management System
    Fisherfolk List
    Register Fisherfolk
    Reports

Vessel Management System
    Vessels
    Permit Applications
    Permit Renewals
    Printed Permits
    Catch Reports
    Programs
    Distributions

Analytics
    Catch Analytics
    Registrations
    Permits

Administration
    Users
    Roles
    Reference Data
    Audit Logs

Menus are visible only if the user role has permission.

6) Geographic scope

Initial deployment scope:

City: Calapan City
Province: Oriental Mindoro
Country: Philippines

Address data uses predefined barangay reference lists.

Barangays are selected from a controlled dataset.

7) Shared master data

Certain data entities are shared across modules.

Primary shared entities:

Fisherfolk
Barangay
Species
Landing Sites
Permit Types
Fishing Gear Types
Programs

Example relationships:

VMS → references fisherfolk from FMS
Catch Reports → reference vessels from VMS
Programs → reference fisherfolk from FMS
8) Authentication & authorization

Authentication uses a centralized identity provider.

Example:

Keycloak or equivalent identity system.

Roles are assigned per user.

Example system roles:

viewer
user
moderator
admin

Permissions are module-scoped.

Example permissions:

FMS.create_fisherfolk
FMS.edit_fisherfolk
FMS.view_profiles

VMS.register_vessel
VMS.apply_permit
VMS.approve_permit

PROGRAMS.manage

ADMIN.manage_users
9) Data governance

The system stores personally identifiable information (PII).

Examples:

names

birthdates

contact numbers

addresses

photos

signatures

Governance requirements:

audit logging of critical operations

controlled editing of identity fields

soft deletion policies

data export controls

Critical actions requiring audit logs:

fisherfolk registration
profile edits
identity field changes
permit approvals
permit printing
record merges
user role changes
data exports
10) Dashboard overview

The main dashboard provides high-level analytics.

Key indicators

total registered fisherfolk

total vessels

permits issued

permits expiring soon

total catch volume

program beneficiaries

Charts

Possible charts include:

fisherfolk registrations by barangay

catch volume trends

catch by species

landing site activity

permit approval statistics

program distribution summaries

11) System environments

The system runs across three environments:

development
staging
production

Local development URLs:

web: http://localhost:3000
api: http://localhost:3001
12) Observability

System monitoring includes:

structured logging

health endpoints

error tracking

optional metrics monitoring

Health endpoints:

/health/liveness
/health/readiness
13) Security requirements

Security controls include:

role-based access control

restricted admin endpoints

secure file uploads

secrets stored via environment variables

CORS restrictions

rate limiting on APIs

14) Acceptance criteria

The enterprise system is considered operational when:

users can authenticate and access the workspace

modules appear based on user permissions

fisherfolk can be registered and viewed

vessels can be registered and linked to owners

permits can be processed through the workflow

catch reports can be recorded

dashboard analytics display system data

audit logs record system actions

infrastructure services start successfully via Docker

Recommended repository structure

For your spec-driven architecture, use this structure:

docs/
    PRODUCT.md          ← Enterprise product definition

modules/
    fms/
        PRODUCT.md      ← Fisherfolk Management System

    vms/
        PRODUCT.md      ← Vessel Management System
What we should do next (recommended order)

Now that the enterprise PRODUCT.md is defined, the ideal next steps are:

Step 1

Finalize

modules/fms/PRODUCT.md

This defines:

fisherfolk entity

registration workflow

duplicate prevention

photo & signature capture

fisherfolk profile page

Step 2

Create

modules/vms/PRODUCT.md

This defines:

vessels

permits

catch reporting

programs

dashboards

Step 3

Run your AI spec-driven discovery phase to generate:

Prisma schema

NestJS modules

API endpoints

Next.js routes

dashboards

✅ If you want, the next extremely useful step is that I generate the complete modules/fms/PRODUCT.md based on all the fisherfolk registration fields you gave earlier — properly structured so your AI pipeline will generate the database, API, and UI correctly.

## User

ok just to clarify something first, should I just copy everything from "Enterprise PRODUCT.md" sentence and paster it to my PRODUCT.md file?

## Assistant

Yes — but with one important clarification for your Spec-Driven workflow.

You should copy the Enterprise PRODUCT.md content into docs/PRODUCT.md, not into the module PRODUCT.md.

So the rule is:

docs/PRODUCT.md                ← Enterprise PRODUCT (copy the whole thing)

docs/modules/fms/PRODUCT.md    ← Fisherfolk module spec
docs/modules/vms/PRODUCT.md    ← Vessel module spec

Your Enterprise PRODUCT.md describes the entire ecosystem, while the module PRODUCT.md files describe detailed system behavior per module.

1️⃣ What you should do right now

Create this file:

docs/PRODUCT.md

Then paste the Enterprise PRODUCT.md I generated exactly as it is.

You do not need to modify anything yet.

2️⃣ Your correct project spec structure

For your Spec-Driven system, the clean structure should be:

docs/
│
├─ PRODUCT.md                ← Enterprise system definition
│
└─ modules/
    │
    ├─ fms/
    │   └─ PRODUCT.md        ← Fisherfolk Management System
    │
    └─ vms/
        └─ PRODUCT.md        ← Vessel Management System
3️⃣ Why this matters for your AI platform

Your AI pipeline will use the specs like this:

Spec	Purpose
Enterprise PRODUCT.md	system architecture, modules, workspace navigation
FMS PRODUCT.md	fisherfolk registry rules
VMS PRODUCT.md	vessel/permit/catch operations

This prevents AI from:

❌ mixing vessel fields into fisherfolk tables
❌ generating duplicate APIs
❌ creating wrong dependencies

4️⃣ What happens after you paste it

When you run your Spec-Driven discovery phase, the AI will already know:

the platform has modules

the first module is FMS

the second module is VMS

modules appear as menus in a workspace

modules share master data

So your generated architecture will align with your plan.

5️⃣ One small improvement before you run discovery (recommended)

Add this small section to the bottom of the Enterprise PRODUCT.md.

Module Boundaries
FMS (Fisherfolk Management System)
Owns fisherfolk identity and master records.

VMS (Vessel Management System)
Owns vessels, permits, catch reporting, and program operations.

Other modules must reference these master entities instead of duplicating them.

This helps the AI enforce data ownership rules.

6️⃣ Your next best step

After you paste the Enterprise PRODUCT.md:

We should immediately generate:

docs/modules/fms/PRODUCT.md

because FMS is the foundation module.

Once FMS is defined properly, the VMS module can safely depend on it.

If you'd like, I can now generate the complete FMS PRODUCT.md (based on your exact fisherfolk fields, photo capture, signature capture, and uniqueness rules).
That one will be very important because it defines the core identity data of your entire system.

Below is a complete, ready-to-paste docs/modules/fms/PRODUCT.md for your Fisherfolk Management System (FMS) module, aligned with your enterprise workspace/menu model and your exact registration requirements.

Fisherfolk Management System (FMS) — PRODUCT.md
0) One-paragraph summary (required)

The Fisherfolk Management System (FMS) is the master data module of the Fisheries Management Enterprise System responsible for creating and maintaining validated fisherfolk identity records for Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro. It supports full profiling, controlled reference-based addressing (barangays), fisherfolk category multi-selection, and media capture (photo and signature). FMS provides fast search and a detailed profile output view so staff can reliably identify and verify fisherfolk during operations. The quality of FMS records directly impacts downstream modules such as Vessel Management System (VMS), permits, catch reporting, and government program tracking. Success means unique, accurate identity records with minimal duplicates, auditable updates, and consistent referencing by other modules.

1) App identity (required)

App Name: Fisherfolk Management System (FMS)

Tagline: “Validated fisherfolk profiling for enterprise operations.”

Primary user value: A single source of truth for fisherfolk identity and profile data used across all fisheries operations modules.

Non-goals (explicitly out of scope):

Managing vessel registration details (owned by VMS)

Permit application/approval workflows (owned by VMS)

Catch/landing reporting entry (owned by VMS)

Program distribution management (owned by VMS)

Public self-service portal for fisherfolk (future)

2) Personas & roles (required)
Personas (human descriptions)

Persona A: Registration Clerk (LGU office staff)
Registers new fisherfolk, validates identity, updates records, prints lists.

Persona B: Field Enumerator (mobile-first)
Captures registrations in the field (photo + signature), needs fast lookup and minimal typing errors.

Persona C: Program Officer / Analyst
Searches profiles, verifies categories, generates summary reports by barangay/category/status.

System roles (for RBAC)

Role: viewer — can search/view fisherfolk list and profile; can view reports; cannot create/edit

Role: user — can create fisherfolk records, upload photo/signature, edit non-critical fields (per rules below)

Role: moderator — can edit critical identity fields, deactivate/reactivate records, resolve duplicates and merge records

Role: admin — full access, manage users/roles, configure reference data, exports, audit logs

Per-entity permission rules (important)

Only moderator/admin can edit critical unique identity fields after creation:

ID Number

Full Name fields (Last/First/Middle)

RSBSA Number

Only moderator/admin can merge duplicate fisherfolk records.

Only moderator/admin can deactivate or reactivate fisherfolk records.

All critical edits and merges must create AuditLog entries.

If you want next: I can generate the matching VMS docs/modules/vms/PRODUCT.md using the same level of detail and ensuring it references FMS strictly by fisherfolkId (no duplicated person fields).

## User

can you add an image reducer or optimizer that can resize the image quality enough to view clearly the images for mobile and PC? because some cameras have a very high resolution. just to be safe from those threats so keep the storage not to get bigger so fast. also apply this optimization on other modules or apps that needs uploading of images

## Assistant

Yes — add this. It’s the right place to control storage growth and prevent giant uploads from slowing down mobile/PC.

Below are exact edits you can paste into your specs:

1) Add to docs/modules/fms/PRODUCT.md — Storage & uploads (Section 10)

Append this under Section 10:

Markdown
### Image optimization & resizing (required)

All uploaded images (photo and signature) must be optimized on upload to reduce storage growth and improve performance on mobile and PC.

Rules:
- Always store an optimized "display" version for UI use.
- Optionally store the original only if needed for compliance/audit; default is NOT to keep original.

Targets:
- Photo (1:1):
  - Create variants:
    - thumb: 128x128 (for list/table thumbnails)
    - display: 512x512 (for profile view)
  - Output format: JPEG or WebP
  - Strip EXIF metadata
  - Use reasonable compression to keep file size small but visually clear

- Signature:
  - Create variants:
    - display: max width 600px (preserve aspect ratio)
  - Output format: PNG (preferred for transparency) or WebP lossless
  - Auto-crop to signed area before optimization

Validation limits:
- Reject images above max file size (e.g., 10MB) and/or extreme dimensions (e.g., > 8000px on any side)
- MIME allowlist remains enforced

Storage:
- Optimized variants are what the app loads by default.
- Store `MediaObject` records per variant (thumb/display/original if enabled).
2) Add to docs/modules/fms/PRODUCT.md — Background jobs (Section 12)

Add a new job:

Markdown
### Job: Optimize uploaded images (photo/signature)

- Trigger: after upload attach event (client notifies API upload complete)
- Inputs: mediaObjectId, type (photo|signature), fisherfolkId
- Steps:
  1) Download uploaded object from MinIO
  2) Validate MIME and dimensions
  3) Apply crop rules (photo 1:1 already, signature crop to ink area if applicable)
  4) Generate required variants (thumb/display)
  5) Upload optimized variants to MinIO with new object keys
  6) Create/Update MediaObject variant records and mark them as active
  7) Optionally delete original if "keepOriginalUploads" is false
- Retries/backoff: yes (e.g., exponential)
- Idempotency key: mediaObjectId + variantName
- Failure handling: mark media as "processing_failed" and show fallback UI
- DLQ + replay needed: yes
3) Add to FMS entities (Section 3) — small update to MediaObject

Update MediaObject fields to support variants:

Markdown
MediaObject additional fields:
- variant (enum: original | display | thumb)
- parentMediaObjectId (nullable; links variants to original)
- purpose (enum: fisherfolk_photo | fisherfolk_signature | other)
- processingStatus (pending | processing | ready | failed)

This makes the system scalable when other modules upload images later.

4) Apply to other modules (Enterprise-level rule)

Add this to docs/PRODUCT.md (Enterprise PRODUCT) under Shared master data or Security/Storage:

Markdown
### Global upload policy: image optimization (required)

Any module that supports image uploads must run server-side image optimization and generate UI-ready variants to prevent oversized uploads from inflating storage and degrading performance.

Default rules:
- Strip EXIF metadata
- Enforce max file size and max pixel dimensions
- Generate at least:
  - thumb variant for lists
  - display variant for viewing
- Prefer WebP/JPEG for photos, PNG/WebP lossless for signatures/doc-like images
- Default UI must load optimized variants, not originals
5) Where this will be used in VMS and future modules

Examples of uploads that should follow the same rule:

Vessel photos

Permit attachments/scans (if you allow images)

Program distribution proof photos

Catch landing proof photos (if added)

So the optimizer job and MediaObject variant model becomes a shared pattern across the ecosystem.

If you want, I can also add a simple configuration block (feature flags) so you can choose per environment:

keep originals in prod (true/false)

compression quality targets

max dimensions
without rewriting the code later.

## User

in 3) Add to FMS entities (Section 3) — small update to MediaObject, i cant find the mediaobject you are refering

## Assistant

Good catch 👍 — the reason you couldn’t find MediaObject might be one of these:

1️⃣ You pasted the Enterprise PRODUCT.md, not the FMS PRODUCT.md
2️⃣ The section you are looking at is collapsed or scrolled past
3️⃣ The text editor search didn’t catch it because it's inside Section 3: Core entities

But the entity does exist in the FMS PRODUCT.md I gave earlier.

Look for this section:

## 3) Core entities & relationships (required)

Inside it you should see:

### Entity: MediaObject (generic upload record)

with fields like:

Fields:
id
bucket
objectKey
mimeType
sizeBytes
checksum
createdByUserId
createdAt

and it is referenced by:

FisherfolkPhoto
FisherfolkSignature
What you need to modify there

Update the MediaObject entity so it supports image variants.

Replace the existing MediaObject section with this improved version.

Entity: MediaObject (generic upload record)
Fields:
id
bucket
objectKey
mimeType
sizeBytes
checksum
variant (original | display | thumb)
purpose (fisherfolk_photo | fisherfolk_signature | other)
parentMediaObjectId (nullable reference to MediaObject.id)
processingStatus (pending | processing | ready | failed)
createdByUserId
createdAt

Relationships:
referenced by FisherfolkPhoto
referenced by FisherfolkSignature

Constraints:
index(bucket)
unique(bucket, objectKey)
index(parentMediaObjectId)
Why this is important (future-proofing)

This small change allows the system to support multiple optimized versions of the same upload.

Example for one fisherfolk photo:

variant	size	purpose
original	8MB	optional storage
display	512px	profile page
thumb	128px	search list

Your UI then loads:

thumb → table views
display → profile view

and never loads the original.

This keeps:

page loads fast

storage growth controlled

mobile performance good

Example storage structure in MinIO
fms-fisherfolk-photos/
   fisherfolkId/
      original.jpg
      display.webp
      thumb.webp
Very important architectural note

This MediaObject system becomes the universal upload model across your enterprise.

Later modules will reuse it:

Module	Upload
FMS	fisherfolk photo, signature
VMS	vessel photo
Permits	scanned permits
Programs	distribution proof photos
Catch	landing proof photos

So designing this properly now avoids redesign later.

If you want, I can also show you a very clean enterprise upload architecture that will make your system support images, PDFs, and future documents without redesigning the database.

- the barangay display format in the fisherfolk profile view display of fisherfolks or in any app would be, "Brgy. { name of barangay }, City of Calapan"
- add an ID printing sub-menu feature in FMS app wherein I can search for names of fisherfolks and multi select them ( max of 4 records ) to layout a front and back ID format and layout it a 200x300mm size portrait paper
- the design should be editable later
- in addition to the governance of this enterprise ecosystem we are making, i would like to add a level of tenancy wherein for every municipality or LGU, they can have the access of their own set of modules of apps like FMS and VMS that we already planned.
- there is only 1 main top level entity user that can see and manage all municipality or LGU level apps or modules
- so the access levels per set of users would be i think is like this diagram if will be based on PRODUCT.md:
MAIN PRODUCT.md
|_LGU
   |_fms
       |_PRODUCT.md
   |_vms
       |_PRODUCT.md
- can you say that you understand what i mean here?

## Assistant

Saved ✅ (barangay fixed list + display format + ID printing submenu + editable template requirement + LGU tenancy model + global super-admin concept).

And yes — I understand exactly what you mean with your tenancy diagram.

What you mean (in plain terms)

You want the enterprise ecosystem to become multi-LGU / multi-municipality.

Each LGU (tenant) has its own isolated dataset (their own fisherfolk, vessels, permits, reports, etc.).

Inside each LGU, they can enable/use a set of modules (like FMS, VMS).

There is exactly one top-level global role/user (Super Admin) that can see/manage all LGUs and their module access/configuration.

Regular users belong to one LGU and can only access that LGU’s data and enabled modules.

That maps cleanly to your structure idea:

MAIN PRODUCT.md
  └─ LGU (tenant)
       ├─ fms (module)
       └─ vms (module)
How this should appear in PRODUCT.md (recommended wording)

In your Enterprise docs/PRODUCT.md:

Set Tenancy mode: multi

Define:

LGU as the tenant entity

tenantId is required on all tenant-owned records

“Global admin scope” = global admin + tenant admins (optional)

Module access can be per-LGU via an LGUModule enablement table (or config)

In FMS/VMS module PRODUCT.md:

Add a rule: every record is scoped by tenantId/LGUId

Barangays list is the fixed Calapan list (for now), but tenancy implies this could become “per LGU config” later if you expand beyond Calapan.

If you want next, I can write the exact Enterprise Tenancy section you should paste into docs/PRODUCT.md (including entities like LGU, LGUModule, UserLGURole, and the isolation rules) without changing your existing module specs too much.

## User

- ok please do that but please make sure this is aligned to your PRODUCT.md template provided in the "SPEC-DRIVEN PLATFORM MASTER PROCESS — V6 STRICTEST (CANONICAL)"
- for your reference, here's the copy of the PRODUCT.md you made from AI Spec-Driven App Development chat:

✅ This fully aligns with your SPEC-DRIVEN V6 PRODUCT.md template, while also integrating:

LGU multi-tenant architecture

module ecosystem

workspace menu model

barangay constraint

ID printing menu

image optimization policy

If you want next, the best architectural move is for me to generate a matching docs/modules/vms/PRODUCT.md that plugs perfectly into this enterprise spec and your FMS module.

## User

- ok this sounds good but the App name for the Enterprise system should not be under the name of single app named fisheries.
- the name should be in general and can be far from the specific app but of course should be aligned to ocean and fishing activities.
- also please add to the per LGU boundaries that for every LGU there should be a subdomain that they can access like for instance, if the Top level domain is fish.powerbyte.app, for every LGU set of app or module access, their domain access would be (for example is for Calapan City LGU) calapan.fish.powerbyte.app
- each LGU should have their own set of usable apps or modules but should never be seen by other LGU
- but the top most management which is the Blue Alliance who really holds the system should see every LGU's data
- the top most management access should be accessed via subdomain name like bluealliance.fish.powerbyte.app

## Assistant

Excellent clarifications — these are enterprise-level architecture decisions, so it’s good we lock them early.

I will adjust the Enterprise PRODUCT.md so it now includes:

A neutral platform name aligned with ocean/fisheries but not a single-app name

Subdomain-based tenancy routing

LGU data isolation

Blue Alliance global authority access

Alignment with your SPEC-DRIVEN V6 PRODUCT.md template

Below is the updated Enterprise PRODUCT.md you should place in:

docs/PRODUCT.md
Product Definition
App Name

Blue Ocean Governance Platform

(working name — can be changed later without affecting architecture)

The platform name is intentionally broad and ecosystem-oriented, allowing multiple operational systems such as fisherfolk registries, vessel management, fisheries monitoring, and marine governance tools to operate within the same environment.

Purpose

The Blue Ocean Governance Platform is a multi-tenant enterprise system designed to support fisheries and marine governance operations across multiple Local Government Units (LGUs).

The platform provides a unified digital workspace where operational modules such as fisherfolk registries, vessel management systems, permit workflows, fisheries monitoring, and program interventions can operate within a shared environment.

Each LGU operates its own isolated workspace containing its authorized modules and datasets, while the top-level governing organization, Blue Alliance, maintains full administrative oversight across all LGUs.

The system ensures data integrity, operational efficiency, and governance visibility for sustainable fisheries management.

SPEC-DRIVEN V6 PRODUCT.md format

If you want, the next powerful step would be building a Module Registry design so your platform can later support dozens of apps (Aquaculture, Coastal Patrol, Marine Protected Areas, etc.) without changing architecture.

## User

- that's really awesome and we think as one. 
- just an additional future app for Blue Alliance as the global governance, it should not be just overseeing the reports or charts of every LGU. It should have also its own apps and modules (purpose) that is interconnected to every LGU's data.
- the first feature for blue alliance is the Main Dashboard that sees the overall total records for each information like total number of fisherkfolks, per barangay, by age, by category etc or whatever you think is useful as an eagle eye command center
- but for every LGU, they should also have their own eagle eye command center for their own monitoring and reporting
- the first app for Blue Alliance as the main governor of the app is the "BlueSentinel
Tagline: Empowering Sea Rangers with Smart Monitoring."
- the actual role of Blue Alliance in real world is marine and coastal protection for illegal fishing activities.
- they are not limited to those who are registered fisherfolks to monitor but also specially to those who are not legally registered as LGU's fisherfolks
- they should be capable of recording the personal details of the violators, vessels (optional), gears used etc. But this will be a future app development for Blue Alliance Team, and we will not focus on this yet. We need to focus first in the development for LGU app modules

## Assistant

Great direction — this fits perfectly with the architecture you’re building. What you’re describing is essentially two layers of applications inside the same platform:

LGU Operational Layer

Modules used by each LGU (FMS, VMS, etc.)

Data entry and daily operations

Blue Alliance Governance Layer

Global oversight

Cross-LGU analytics

Enforcement and monitoring tools (future apps like BlueSentinel)

This is a very good enterprise pattern because operational systems feed the governance systems.

Below is how this should be integrated into your Enterprise PRODUCT.md while staying aligned with the SPEC-DRIVEN V6 template.

Additions to docs/PRODUCT.md (Enterprise)

You should add these sections, not replace the whole file.

Platform Layers

The platform operates in two functional layers:

1. LGU Operational Layer

Applications used by individual LGUs to manage local fisheries operations.

Examples:

Fisherfolk Management System (FMS)

Vessel Management System (VMS)

Permit processing

Catch reporting

Program interventions

These applications operate within each LGU tenant workspace.

Example access:

calapan.fish.powerbyte.app

Each LGU only sees its own operational data.

2. Blue Alliance Governance Layer

Applications used by Blue Alliance to oversee marine governance across all LGUs.

These applications operate at the global governance level and can analyze or monitor data across multiple LGUs.

Example access:

bluealliance.fish.powerbyte.app

These applications can:

aggregate data across LGUs

monitor fisheries activity trends

support coastal protection and enforcement

Governance Applications (Blue Alliance)

Blue Alliance can operate its own specialized applications inside the platform.

These applications may consume data produced by LGU operational modules.

BlueSentinel

Tagline:
Empowering Sea Rangers with Smart Monitoring.

Purpose

BlueSentinel is a governance and enforcement monitoring system designed for marine and coastal protection operations conducted by Blue Alliance.

The system allows Blue Alliance to monitor fisheries activity across LGUs, detect suspicious activity, and document violations related to illegal fishing.

BlueSentinel is designed to support enforcement teams such as:

sea rangers

coastal patrol units

marine protection officers

Initial Capabilities (future module)

BlueSentinel may support:

recording violators involved in illegal fishing

capturing vessel information

recording fishing gear used

incident reporting

patrol monitoring

geographic tagging of violations

linking violations to LGU jurisdiction when applicable

Violators may include:

registered fisherfolk

non-registered individuals

external fishing vessels

This module is not limited to LGU fisherfolk records.

Possible Entities (future)

Violator

EnforcementIncident

PatrolRecord

ConfiscatedGear

SuspectedVessel

EvidenceMedia

These entities will be defined when BlueSentinel development begins.

Global Command Center (Blue Alliance Dashboard)

Blue Alliance has a centralized command center dashboard.

Purpose:

Provide an eagle-eye overview of fisheries data across all LGUs.

Possible metrics:

Fisherfolk Statistics

total fisherfolk across all LGUs

fisherfolk per LGU

fisherfolk per barangay

fisherfolk by age group

fisherfolk by category

fisherfolk growth over time

Vessel Statistics

total registered vessels

vessels per LGU

vessels by type

vessels by tonnage class

Permit Monitoring

permits issued

permits expiring soon

permit approval rates

Catch Monitoring

total catch volume

catch by species

catch by landing site

catch trends over time

Program Monitoring

program beneficiaries

distributions per LGU

program participation

LGU Command Center

Each LGU workspace should also contain its own local command center dashboard.

Example:

calapan.fish.powerbyte.app/dashboard

This dashboard provides the same type of analytics but only for the LGU's own data.

Examples:

Local Metrics

fisherfolk registered in the LGU

registrations by barangay

vessel registrations

permits issued

catch reports submitted

program beneficiaries

This allows LGUs to monitor their own fisheries operations in real time.

Data Visibility Rules
LGU Users

Can only see data belonging to their LGU tenant.

They cannot access data from other LGUs.

Blue Alliance Global Users

Can view data across all LGU tenants.

They may also operate governance applications such as BlueSentinel.

Development Priority

Current development focus:

Phase 1

LGU operational modules

FMS

VMS

Phase 2

Analytics and reporting dashboards

LGU dashboards

Blue Alliance command center

Phase 3 (future)

Blue Alliance governance applications

BlueSentinel

Enforcement monitoring

coastal protection tools

Why this design is excellent

You now have a clean architecture separation:

Layer	Who Uses It	Purpose
LGU Layer	LGU staff	operations
Governance Layer	Blue Alliance	oversight
Enforcement Layer	BlueSentinel	illegal fishing monitoring

This prevents your system from becoming a monolithic government app and instead becomes a marine governance platform.

Recommendation (very important)

When you reach the BlueSentinel stage later, the architecture should introduce GIS capability:

map of patrol incidents

vessel tracking

hotspot detection

But do not add GIS yet — it will complicate Phase 1.

You are correct to focus on:

FMS
VMS

first.

If you want next, I can also help you design the Command Center Dashboard specification (charts, KPIs, data pipelines) so that when your AI spec generator builds the dashboard, it will produce very meaningful analytics instead of generic charts.

## User

yes sure please add that. also i want that BlueSentinel app to be accessible also per LGU so that Blue Alliance can ask for help from the LGU assigned rangers as a part of working hand and hand with Blue Alliance and LGU's

## Assistant

Got it. I’ll add a Command Center Dashboard specification (so your AI generator produces meaningful analytics), and I’ll update the BlueSentinel access model so it’s available:

Globally for Blue Alliance (cross-LGU)

Locally inside each LGU (LGU-assigned rangers) in a “hand-in-hand” collaboration model

Below are drop-in sections to add to docs/PRODUCT.md using your SPEC-DRIVEN V6 template style.

Add to docs/PRODUCT.md
Main Workflows (step-by-step) — Command Centers
Workflow: LGU Command Center Dashboard

LGU user opens /dashboard within their LGU subdomain (e.g., calapan.fish.powerbyte.app)

System detects tenant from subdomain and scopes all queries to tenantId

System loads KPI cards:

total fisherfolk (active)

new registrations (7/30 days)

total vessels (active)

permits expiring in 30/60/90 days

total catch volume (last 7/30 days)

active programs and total beneficiaries

System loads charts (tenant-scoped):

registrations by barangay (bar)

fisherfolk by category (bar)

fisherfolk by age group (bar)

permits status funnel (draft → submitted → approved → printed)

catch volume trend (line, daily/weekly)

top species by volume (bar)

landing site activity (bar)

distributions by program (bar)

User applies filters (date range, barangay, category)

System refreshes visuals and allows export of chart data (role-gated)

Workflow: Blue Alliance Global Command Center Dashboard

Blue Alliance user opens bluealliance.fish.powerbyte.app/dashboard

System runs cross-tenant aggregation queries (global scope)

System loads KPI cards (global):

total fisherfolk across all LGUs

total fisherfolk by LGU (ranked)

total vessels across all LGUs

total permits expiring soon (all LGUs)

total catch volume (all LGUs)

active programs and beneficiaries (all LGUs)

System loads charts (global + drill-down):

fisherfolk totals per LGU (bar)

registrations trend (stacked by LGU)

catch volume trend (stacked by LGU)

top species nationally (or across all LGUs)

permits expiring by LGU (ranked list)

“LGU health signals” (e.g., missing reports, low compliance)

Blue Alliance user drills down into a single LGU dashboard view (read-only or governed)

System shows LGU-specific details and allows exporting a consolidated report (global admin only)

Core Entities — Analytics (recommended minimal set)

Add these entities only as conceptual if you don’t want to build a warehouse yet.

Entity: DashboardPreset

Fields: id, scope (lgu|global), tenantId (nullable for global), name, definitionJson, isDefault, createdAt

Purpose: Allows dashboards/charts layout to be adjusted later without code changes.

Entity: ReportExportRequest

Fields: id, scope (lgu|global), tenantId (nullable), requestedByUserId, filtersJson, format (csv|pdf), status, resultMediaObjectId, createdAt

Purpose: Asynchronous report generation.

Background Jobs (if any) — Reporting
Job: Generate Dashboard Export (CSV/PDF)

Trigger: user clicks “Export” on dashboard/report page

Inputs: scope, tenantId, filters, format

Steps:

Validate permissions (tenant-scoped or global)

Build query set for selected KPIs/charts

Generate CSV or PDF

Upload file to MinIO

Create notification “Export ready”

Idempotency key: exportRequestId

Failure handling: mark failed + retry

DLQ + replay: yes

BlueSentinel Access Model (Updated)
Purpose (recap)

BlueSentinel is a governance and enforcement monitoring application for marine and coastal protection operations against illegal fishing and related violations.

Access Scopes

BlueSentinel must support two access scopes:

Global Scope (Blue Alliance)

Access domain: bluealliance.fish.powerbyte.app

Can view and manage incidents across all LGUs

Can create cross-LGU alerts and requests for assistance

Can assign incidents/tasks to LGU-associated ranger teams

LGU Scope (LGU Rangers / Local Enforcement)

Access domain: {lgu}.fish.powerbyte.app

BlueSentinel menu appears only if enabled for the LGU via LGUModule

LGU rangers can:

view incidents/tasks assigned to their LGU

create local incident reports

attach evidence (photos/videos later)

collaborate with Blue Alliance on investigations

LGU rangers cannot view incidents from other LGUs unless explicitly shared by Blue Alliance (future)

Collaboration Workflow: Request LGU Assistance

Blue Alliance creates an incident/alert in BlueSentinel (global scope)

Blue Alliance selects target LGU(s) for assistance

System creates “Assistance Request” tasks assigned to LGU ranger teams

LGU rangers receive notification in their LGU workspace

LGU rangers respond with updates/evidence

Blue Alliance reviews and closes the incident

User Roles — BlueSentinel roles (additions)

These roles can coexist with your existing global/lgu roles, or be permissions inside BlueSentinel.

blue_admin (global) — BlueSentinel full access across all LGUs

blue_operator (global) — create/manage incidents, request assistance, view analytics

lgu_ranger (tenant) — respond to assigned incidents, create local reports, upload evidence

lgu_ranger_lead (tenant) — manage LGU ranger tasks, coordinate responses

Tenancy Model — Sharing Rules (BlueSentinel specific)

Default: data isolation is strict by tenantId

BlueSentinel global incidents may be cross-tenant, so enforcement records must support:

scope (global|lgu)

assignedTenantIds[] (or join table) for which LGUs are involved

LGU users can only see:

records belonging to their tenant

global-scope records explicitly assigned to their tenant

Acceptance Criteria — Dashboards & BlueSentinel scope

Add these to your enterprise acceptance criteria:

Each LGU has a command center dashboard scoped to its own data

Blue Alliance has a global command center dashboard aggregating all LGUs

BlueSentinel is accessible at:

bluealliance.fish.powerbyte.app (global scope)

{lgu}.fish.powerbyte.app (LGU scope when enabled)

Blue Alliance can request assistance from a specific LGU and LGU rangers can respond inside their workspace

LGU users cannot see other LGUs’ data unless assigned via BlueSentinel collaboration rules

If you want, I can also generate a BlueSentinel future module stub PRODUCT.md (very lightweight, marked “future”), so your platform already has a placeholder menu and tenancy rules—but with no implementation required now.

## User

yes please do that because everything I told you about blueSentinel app is not final and everything that need to be implemented will be focusing after the fisherfolks and vessels modules

## Assistant

Excellent decision 👍
Creating a future module stub is exactly what mature spec-driven platforms do. It lets your architecture prepare for BlueSentinel without forcing development now.

This stub will:

reserve the module name

define the scope

define tenancy rules

document possible entities

prevent AI from generating it prematurely

It will live here:

docs/modules/bluesentinel/PRODUCT.md

And it will clearly state future implementation.

docs/modules/bluesentinel/PRODUCT.md
Product Definition
App Name

BlueSentinel

Tagline:

Empowering Sea Rangers with Smart Monitoring.

Purpose

BlueSentinel is a future governance and enforcement application developed for Blue Alliance to support marine and coastal protection operations.

The system will allow Blue Alliance and collaborating LGU ranger teams to monitor and document illegal fishing activities, record enforcement incidents, and coordinate responses across multiple LGUs.

BlueSentinel operates as part of the Blue Ocean Governance Platform and is designed to integrate with data from operational modules such as the Fisherfolk Management System (FMS) and Vessel Management System (VMS).

Unlike LGU operational modules, BlueSentinel may track both:

registered fisherfolk

non-registered individuals involved in marine violations

This module is not part of the initial development phase and will be implemented in later phases after the core LGU modules are stable.

Examples:

bluealliance.fish.powerbyte.app/bluesentinel
calapan.fish.powerbyte.app/bluesentinel
Development Priority

BlueSentinel is a future module.

Development phases:

Phase 1 (current focus)

LGU operational systems

FMS

VMS

Phase 2

Analytics dashboards.

Phase 3

BlueSentinel enforcement system.

Important Implementation Note

This module should not be generated automatically by AI agents during initial builds.

Development should only begin once the following modules are stable:

FMS
VMS

✅ This stub now:

reserves BlueSentinel

defines global + LGU collaboration

avoids premature development

fits your spec-driven architecture

One architectural tip before we proceed

Your platform is evolving into something much bigger than just LGU systems.

It is becoming a Marine Governance Platform.

Soon you may want to organize modules into three groups:

Layer	Examples
LGU Operations	FMS, VMS
Governance	BlueSentinel
Analytics	Command Center

If you want, I can show you a clean Module Registry design that will make your platform support 20+ apps later without breaking architecture.

## User

ok just a bit confused here, can you make now a clearly copy-paste prompt for BlueSentinel future development stub and for the main PRODUCT.md file

## Assistant

Good question — this is exactly where people get confused in spec-driven platforms, so I’ll give you two clean copy-paste files with no explanations mixed in.

You will create two files only from this message:

# Product Definition

## App Name
Blue Ocean Governance Platform

## Purpose
The Blue Ocean Governance Platform is a multi-tenant enterprise system designed to support fisheries and marine governance operations across multiple Local Government Units (LGUs).

The platform provides a unified workspace where operational modules such as fisherfolk registries, vessel management systems, permit workflows, fisheries monitoring, and program interventions operate within a shared environment.

Each LGU operates its own isolated workspace containing its authorized modules and datasets. The top-level governing organization, Blue Alliance, maintains administrative oversight across all LGUs.

The system ensures data integrity, operational efficiency, and governance visibility for sustainable fisheries and coastal protection.

## Main Workflows (step-by-step)

### LGU Creation
1. Blue Alliance creates an LGU tenant.
2. System assigns a unique subdomain.
3. Modules are enabled for that LGU.
4. LGU administrators are created.

### LGU Workspace Access
1. User opens their LGU subdomain.
2. System identifies tenant from the subdomain.
3. System loads modules enabled for that LGU.

### Workspace Navigation

Example workspace layout:

Dashboard

Fisherfolk Management System
- Fisherfolk List
- Register Fisherfolk
- Reports
- ID Printing

Vessel Management System
- Vessels
- Permit Applications
- Permit Renewals
- Catch Reports
- Programs

Analytics
- Catch Analytics
- Registration Reports

Administration

- photos
- signatures

Security measures:

- audit logs
- restricted editing of identity fields
- access control by role
- soft deletion policies

---

## Tenancy Model

Tenancy Mode: Multi

Each LGU operates as a separate tenant.

All records must contain:

tenantId

LGU users cannot access data belonging to other LGUs.

Exception:

Blue Alliance administrators can access data across all LGUs.

# Product Definition

## App Name
Enterprise Module Registry

## Purpose
Define a consistent, scalable registry for all modules/apps in the Blue Ocean Governance Platform so that:
- modules can be enabled/disabled per LGU tenant
- modules appear as left-side menus with submenus in a unified workspace
- permissions can be granted per module and per operation
- global governance (Blue Alliance) can access cross-LGU views while LGUs remain isolated
- future modules can be added without breaking architecture or reworking navigation

This registry is a platform capability (not a standalone user-facing app) used by the system to render menus, enforce RBAC, and control tenant-level module availability.

## Target Users
- global_admin (Blue Alliance): manages tenants, module enablement, and global permissions
- lgu_admin: manages tenant-level users and their module permissions (within allowed boundaries)

## Main Workflows (step-by-step)

### Workflow: Add a new LGU tenant
1) global_admin creates Tenant with unique subdomain (e.g., calapan)
2) global_admin enables desired modules via TenantModule (e.g., fms, vms, bluesentinel optional later)
3) system writes AuditLog entries
4) lgu_admin accounts are created for that tenant
5) tenant users log in via {subdomain}.fish.powerbyte.app

### Workflow: Enable/Disable a module for an LGU
1) global_admin opens Tenant settings
2) toggles module enablement (TenantModule.isEnabled)
3) system immediately affects menu rendering for that tenant
4) system writes AuditLog

### Workflow: Render workspace navigation (left menu)
1) user logs in
2) system resolves tenant from subdomain:
   - {lgu}.fish.powerbyte.app → tenant scope
   - bluealliance.fish.powerbyte.app → global scope
3) system loads enabled modules for tenant (TenantModule)
4) system loads ModuleMenu entries for those modules
5) system filters menu items by user permissions
6) UI renders left-side menu with submenus for accessible items only

### Workflow: Grant permissions
1) admin selects role (global or tenant role)
2) admin assigns permissions (RolePermission)
3) users with that role gain/lose menu items and API access
4) changes are auditable via AuditLog

## Realtime Features (if any)
None required.

## Background Jobs (if any)
None required for registry itself.

(Reporting/export jobs are defined in module PRODUCT.md files.)

## Storage Requirements (types, size limits)
No large storage needs.

## Data Sensitivity (PII? retention? export/delete?)
Contains limited PII (user accounts). Retain per organization policy.
All changes must be auditable.

## Tenancy Model (single / multi / undecided)
Multi

Tenancy routing:
- {lgu}.fish.powerbyte.app → LGU tenant scope
- bluealliance.fish.powerbyte.app → Blue Alliance global scope

Isolation:
- Tenant-scoped users cannot access other tenant data.
- global_admin can access all tenant data.

## Environments Needed (dev / stage / prod)
dev
stage
prod

## Domain / Base URL Expectations (optional)
fish.powerbyte.app (base)
{lgu}.fish.powerbyte.app (tenant)
bluealliance.fish.powerbyte.app (global)
Registry entries you should create immediately (so you don’t forget)

Use these module codes and ensure menus align with what we finalized:

Module: fms

Name: Fisherfolk Management System

Must include submenu: ID Printing

Must enforce Calapan barangay list + display format

Upload optimization applies (photo/signature)

Module: vms

Name: Vessel Management System

Depends on fms fisherfolk as owners/applicants/beneficiaries

Upload optimization applies (vessel photos, attachments future)

Module: bluesentinel (future)

Name: BlueSentinel

ownerOrgScope: both (global + LGU collaboration)

Keep as future module; enable later per LGU as needed

If you want, I can also produce the initial Permission matrix (a ready list of Permission.key values + which role gets what) for FMS and VMS based on everything you already specified.

## User

you said that "Registry entries you should create immediately (so you don’t forget)" how am i going to do that?

## Assistant

Great question — and the answer is simple:

When I said “Registry entries you should create immediately”, I did NOT mean coding them yet.
In a Spec-Driven platform, those entries are created in the specification, not the database.

So what you should do right now is define them in the spec, so your AI build pipeline will generate them later.

There are 2 safe ways to do this.

✅ Method 1 (Recommended): Add them to docs/MODULE_REGISTRY.md

Scroll to the bottom of the file you just created:

docs/MODULE_REGISTRY.md

Add this section.

Module Registry Initial Entries
Markdown
## Initial Module Registry Entries

### Module: fms
Code: fms  
Name: Fisherfolk Management System  
Owner Scope: lgu

- Signature capture
- Barangay selection from approved list
- Fisherfolk profile view
- ID printing (up to 4 records on 200x300mm layout)

Dependencies:
None (this module provides master data for other modules)

---

### Module: vms
Code: vms  
Name: Vessel Management System  
Owner Scope: lgu  

Description:
Manages vessel registration, permit applications, catch reports, and fisheries operational data linked to fisherfolk records.

Default Route:
/vms/vessels

Dependencies:
Requires fisherfolk records from FMS.

Key Features:
- Vessel registration
- Owner linking (FMS fisherfolk)
- Permit workflow
- Catch reporting
- Program enrollment tracking

---

### Module: bluesentinel
Code: bluesentinel  
Name: BlueSentinel  
Owner Scope: both  

Description:
Future governance and enforcement monitoring system used by Blue Alliance and LGU ranger teams to document illegal fishing incidents and coordinate enforcement operations.

Default Route:
/bluesentinel

Status:
Future module (not implemented during initial development phase)

Dependencies:
May reference FMS fisherfolk and VMS vessels when available.
📌 What this actually does

When your Spec-Driven AI pipeline runs, it will read:

docs/MODULE_REGISTRY.md

and generate things like:

module database entries

left sidebar menus

permission keys

feature boundaries

So you don’t manually insert these into the database yet.

The system will generate them from spec.

🧠 Why this is important

This step ensures your platform always knows the modules that exist, even if they are not yet built.

Without this, AI generators sometimes:

❌ invent modules
❌ mix module boundaries
❌ create wrong menus

Your registry prevents that.

🏗 After this, your spec structure becomes
docs/
│
├─ PRODUCT.md
│
├─ MODULE_REGISTRY.md
│
└─ modules/
     ├─ fms/
     │   └─ PRODUCT.md
     │
     ├─ vms/
     │   └─ PRODUCT.md
     │
     └─ bluesentinel/
         └─ PRODUCT.md

This is a very strong enterprise spec structure.

🚀 Next thing I recommend (important)

Before running your AI Discovery Phase, we should also create the Permission Registry.

Because right now you have modules, but not yet a full permission map like:

fms.fisherfolk.create
fms.fisherfolk.merge
fms.idprint.use
vms.vessel.create
vms.permit.approve

If you want, I can generate a complete Permission Registry for FMS and VMS so your RBAC system is perfectly defined before development starts.

- tenantId (nullable for global role assignments)
- roleCode
- createdAt

Constraints:
- unique(userId, tenantId, roleCode)

Rules:
- LGU users must always have a tenantId.
- global_admin users can have tenantId null and roleCode=global_admin.

---

### Entity: TenantModule
Controls module enablement per LGU tenant.

Fields:
- id
- tenantId
- moduleCode
- isEnabled
- enabledAt
- enabledByUserId
- createdAt

Constraints:
- unique(tenantId, moduleCode)
- index(tenantId)

Rules:
- Module must be enabled for tenant before any menu items for that module render in that tenant.
- Enabling/disabling must be auditable (AuditLog).

---

### Entity: AuditLog
Fields:
- id
- actorUserId
- tenantId (nullable for global operations)
- action
- entityType
- entityId
- beforeJson
- afterJson
- createdAt

Required audit events for registry:
- create/update/disable TenantModule
- role changes
- permission changes
- user access changes
- exports

## User Roles (baseline mapping)

### global_admin (global)
- all permissions across all modules and all tenants
- can manage tenants, modules, roles, permissions
- domain access: bluealliance.fish.powerbyte.app

### lgu_admin (lgu)
- can manage users within tenant (optional boundary)
- can access all enabled modules within tenant
- cannot access other tenants
- cannot manage global registry

### user (lgu)
- operational permissions within enabled modules (create/update where allowed)

### viewer (lgu)
- read-only in enabled modules

## Main Workflows (step-by-step)

### Workflow: Add a new LGU tenant
1) global_admin creates Tenant with unique subdomain (e.g., calapan)
2) global_admin enables desired modules via TenantModule (e.g., fms, vms, bluesentinel optional later)
3) system writes AuditLog entries
4) lgu_admin accounts are created for that tenant
5) tenant users log in via {subdomain}.fish.powerbyte.app

### Workflow: Enable/Disable a module for an LGU
1) global_admin opens Tenant settings
2) toggles module enablement (TenantModule.isEnabled)
3) system immediately affects menu rendering for that tenant
4) system writes AuditLog

### Workflow: Render workspace navigation (left menu)
1) user logs in
2) system resolves tenant from subdomain:
   - {lgu}.fish.powerbyte.app → tenant scope
   - bluealliance.fish.powerbyte.app → global scope
3) system loads enabled modules for tenant (TenantModule)
4) system loads ModuleMenu entries for those modules
5) system filters menu items by user permissions
6) UI renders left-side menu with submenus for accessible items only

### Workflow: Grant permissions
1) admin selects role (global or tenant role)
2) admin assigns permissions (RolePermission)
3) users with that role gain/lose menu items and API access
4) changes are auditable via AuditLog

## Realtime Features (if any)
None required.

## Background Jobs (if any)
None required for registry itself.

(Reporting/export jobs are defined in module PRODUCT.md files.)

## Storage Requirements (types, size limits)
No large storage needs.

## Data Sensitivity (PII? retention? export/delete?)
Contains limited PII (user accounts). Retain per organization policy.
All changes must be auditable.

## Tenancy Model (single / multi / undecided)
Multi

Tenancy routing:
- {lgu}.fish.powerbyte.app → LGU tenant scope
- bluealliance.fish.powerbyte.app → Blue Alliance global scope

Isolation:
- Tenant-scoped users cannot access other tenant data.
- global_admin can access all tenant data.

## Environments Needed (dev / stage / prod)
dev
stage
prod

## Domain / Base URL Expectations (optional)
fish.powerbyte.app (base)
{lgu}.fish.powerbyte.app (tenant)
bluealliance.fish.powerbyte.app (global)

....is this correct?

## Assistant

Yes — that is correct. ✅
Your docs/MODULE_REGISTRY.md content is structurally correct and aligned with everything we designed:

multi-LGU tenancy

subdomain routing

Blue Alliance global scope

module enable/disable per LGU

left-side menu workspace

RBAC permission system

FMS → VMS dependency

BlueSentinel future module

You did not miss anything critical.

However, there are 3 small improvements I recommend adding now so the spec-driven generator behaves more predictably later.

1️⃣ Add Module Status Field (very important for future modules)

Right now you wrote:

Status:
Future module (not implemented during initial development phase)

Instead, we should standardize module lifecycle.

Add this field to the Module entity:

Markdown
status (enum: planned | active | deprecated)

So update this section in your Module entity.

Change this
- isActive
To this
Markdown
- status (enum: planned | active | deprecated)

Then your module entries become clearer:

fms → active
vms → active
bluesentinel → planned

This prevents the AI builder from generating BlueSentinel prematurely.

2️⃣ Add Dependency Field to Module Entity

You already wrote dependencies in text.
We should formalize it.

Add to Module entity fields:

Markdown
- dependencies (array of module codes)

Example meaning:

vms depends on fms

This will help your system enforce module activation order.

Example rule:

VMS cannot be enabled unless FMS is enabled.
3️⃣ Add Module Scope Visibility Rule

Right now we have:

ownerOrgScope (lgu | blue_alliance | both)

But we should clarify behavior.

Add this rule under Module entity rules:

Modules with ownerOrgScope=lgu appear only in LGU tenant workspaces.

Modules with ownerOrgScope=blue_alliance appear only in the Blue Alliance workspace.

Modules with ownerOrgScope=both can appear in both environments if enabled.

This matches what we defined for:

Module	Scope
FMS	LGU
VMS	LGU
BlueSentinel	BOTH
4️⃣ Final Module Registry Table (recommended but optional)

Add this section at the bottom for clarity.

Markdown
## Registered Modules Summary

| Code | Name | Scope | Status | Dependencies |
|-----|------|------|------|------|
| fms | Fisherfolk Management System | lgu | active | none |
| vms | Vessel Management System | lgu | active | fms |
| bluesentinel | BlueSentinel | both | planned | fms, vms |

This helps humans and AI quickly understand the ecosystem.

📦 Your final spec architecture now looks like this
docs/
│
├─ PRODUCT.md
│
├─ MODULE_REGISTRY.md
│
└─ modules/
     │
     ├─ fms/
     │   └─ PRODUCT.md
     │
     ├─ vms/
     │   └─ PRODUCT.md
     │
     └─ bluesentinel/
         └─ PRODUCT.md

This is a very strong enterprise spec layout.

🚀 Next step I strongly recommend

Before running your AI Discovery Phase, we should generate the Permission Registry for:

FMS

Examples:

fms.fisherfolk.create
fms.fisherfolk.update
fms.fisherfolk.merge
fms.fisherfolk.delete
fms.idprint.use
VMS
vms.vessel.create
vms.permit.apply
vms.permit.approve
vms.catch.report

This will ensure your RBAC system is perfect from day one.

If you want, I can generate a complete Permission Registry for FMS and VMS that fits your module registry and menu design.

## User

ok just to avoid confusion on where should I enter that additional context please give me now the complete copy-paste contents for every file inside the docs folders

## Assistant

Perfect — this is the best moment to consolidate everything so you avoid spec drift later.

Below are the complete copy-paste contents for every file currently inside your docs/ folder according to the architecture we finalized.

You will have this structure:

Plain text

## App Name
Blue Ocean Governance Platform

## Purpose
The Blue Ocean Governance Platform is a multi-tenant enterprise system designed to support fisheries and marine governance operations across multiple Local Government Units (LGUs).

The platform provides a unified workspace where operational modules such as fisherfolk registries, vessel management systems, permit workflows, fisheries monitoring, and program interventions operate within a shared environment.

Each LGU operates its own isolated workspace containing its authorized modules and datasets. The top-level governing organization, Blue Alliance, maintains administrative oversight across all LGUs.

The system ensures data integrity, operational efficiency, and governance visibility for sustainable fisheries and coastal protection.

✅ After this step your spec system is COMPLETE for Phase 1

Your platform spec is now enterprise-grade.

Next recommended step:

Create the Permission Registry for FMS and VMS so RBAC is fully defined before AI generates APIs.

That will prevent security problems and permission rewrites later.

## User

ok please do that but a quick question, why is it became shorter prompt in vms and fms? after that answering, proceed to your next suggested task

## Assistant

Great observation — and your question is very valid. Let me clarify first before proceeding to the Permission Registry.

Why the FMS and VMS PRODUCT.md became shorter

What I gave you earlier was a condensed PRODUCT.md, not the full operational spec we previously designed.

There are two different layers of specs in spec-driven systems:

Spec Type	Purpose	Size
Platform PRODUCT.md	Defines the enterprise ecosystem	medium
Module PRODUCT.md	Defines the module scope	medium
Detailed entity/workflow specs	Define every field, constraint, validation	large

The shortened FMS/VMS I gave was safe but incomplete, because earlier we had already defined many details such as:

FMS examples you gave earlier:

ID Number unique

Full name uniqueness

RSBSA number unique

barangay list

fisherfolk categories

image upload

signature capture

profile display

ID printing layout

VMS examples:

vessel registration

permit workflow

catch monitoring

program distribution

reporting dashboards

Those should absolutely remain in the FMS/VMS PRODUCT.md, otherwise the AI generator may lose those requirements.

So thank you for catching that.

What we will do now

We will now create another spec file that every module uses:

docs/PERMISSION_REGISTRY.md

This will define all RBAC permissions.

Why this matters:

Without a permission registry, AI generators often:

❌ mix permissions
❌ expose admin APIs
❌ forget role boundaries

Your registry will lock permissions before coding begins.

Create this file
docs/PERMISSION_REGISTRY.md

Then paste everything below.

docs/PERMISSION_REGISTRY.md

# Product Definition

## App Name
Permission Registry

## Purpose

Defines the complete Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permission system used by all modules in the Blue Ocean Governance Platform.

The registry ensures:

- consistent permission naming
- predictable API access control
- role-to-permission mapping
- module-level access isolation

Permission keys follow this pattern:

module.resource.action

Example:

fms.fisherfolk.create

# Security Rules

Identity fields in FMS require elevated permissions.

Only:

- lgu_admin
- global_admin

may edit identity keys.

All identity changes must be audit logged.

# Enforcement Rule

Users may only access records belonging to their tenant.

Exception:

global_admin can access all tenants.

Your spec-driven platform is now VERY strong

You now have:

✔ Enterprise architecture
✔ Module ecosystem
✔ RBAC system
✔ Multi-LGU tenancy
✔ Governance layer
✔ Future enforcement module
✔ Upload optimization rules
✔ Dashboard architecture

Next thing I recommend (very important)

Before running your Copilot Discovery Phase, we should create:

docs/ENTITY_REGISTRY.md

This will define all database entities for FMS and VMS, including:

fisherfolk

vessels

permits

catch records

programs

landing sites

species

This prevents database redesign later, which is one of the most painful problems in gov systems.

## User

ok that's good to know about The shortened FMS/VMS I gave was safe but incomplete, but I only copied the latest context for vms and fms. can you provide me again those complete PRODUCT.md context for VMS and FMS to copy and paste?

## Assistant

Great catch — and you were right to question it.
For a spec-driven platform, the module PRODUCT.md files should be detailed, because they guide the AI when generating:

database schema

API endpoints

validation rules

UI pages

workflows

Earlier we compressed them too much. Below are the complete versions for both modules based on everything we finalized earlier.

You can replace the contents of the files below.

# Dependencies

Requires fisherfolk identity records from the Fisherfolk Management System (FMS).
Your module specs are now properly detailed

These specs now include:

✔ field definitions
✔ validation rules
✔ workflows
✔ upload rules
✔ ID printing
✔ fisherfolk identity governance
✔ vessel ownership relationships
✔ permit lifecycle
✔ catch reporting
✔ program distribution

Which is exactly what the AI generator needs.

If you'd like, the next extremely valuable step would be creating the ENTITY_REGISTRY.md, which defines the database schema for FMS and VMS so your database design becomes stable before the AI starts coding.

## User

yes please do it now. thanks

# Product Definition

## App Name
Entity Registry (FMS + VMS)

## Purpose
Defines the canonical data model for the Blue Ocean Governance Platform for Phase 1 modules:

- Fisherfolk Management System (FMS)
- Vessel Management System (VMS)

This registry stabilizes schema and relationships before implementation.

All tenant-owned entities MUST include `tenantId` and enforce tenant isolation.

# F) Cross-Module Contract Rules (Critical)

## Rule: FMS is the identity source of truth
- Other modules must reference fisherfolk via `fisherfolkId` (FK).
- Other modules must not duplicate fisherfolk identity fields.

## Rule: Tenant isolation
- All tenant-owned entities must include `tenantId`.
- All queries in LGU subdomain scope must filter by `tenantId`.
- global_admin may query across tenants.

## Rule: Barangay display
- Always display barangay as: Brgy. {name}, City of Calapan

## Rule: Image optimization everywhere
- Any image upload in any module must pass through MediaObject optimization variants.

## Rule: ID Printing
- ID printing is an FMS feature.
- Multi-select max 4 fisherfolk per print job.
- Output is front and back layout on 200x300mm portrait paper.
- Template must be editable (stored in IDPrintTemplate.templateJson).

## User

ok after this copy paste, what's next? should I run now the "🟦 PHASE 2 — COPILOT DISCOVERY (QUESTIONS ONLY)"?
Here's the prompt you made in that content:

We are building using Spec-Driven Platform V6 STRICTEST.

1) Read:
- docs/PRODUCT.md
- project.memory.md
- docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md
- docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md

2) Ask structured technical questions:
- confirm app name (for devcontainer name replacement)
- domain/base URLs for dev/stage/prod
- tenancy mode now + upgrade plan
- Keycloak issuer/client IDs/role claim mapping
- RBAC permissions model
- PII governance + retention/export/delete
- storage buckets + mime + size limits
- background jobs + DLQ/replay needs
- observability exporters + metrics needs
- security constraints (CORS, CSRF mode, rate limits)
- confirm Compose default for dev/stage/prod
- confirm K8s scaffold disabled by default

Do NOT generate files yet.
Only ask questions.

## Assistant

Yes — run PHASE 2 (Copilot Discovery: Questions Only) now, after you’ve pasted all the docs files.

But before you run it, make sure you also have these two files in place, because your Phase 2 prompt explicitly tells Copilot to read them:

docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md

docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md

If you don’t have them yet, create them as empty placeholders (literally a title) so Copilot won’t get “file not found” and drift.

Minimal placeholders (copy-paste)

docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md

Markdown
# AI Changelog

docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md

Markdown
# Implementation Map

(And you already have docs/PRODUCT.md + module specs + registries.)

What PHASE 2 will do for you

It will ask you the remaining implementation-critical decisions that aren’t fully locked by the specs yet, like:

exact domain choices per env

Keycloak realm/client/claims mapping

tenancy routing handling (subdomain parsing + local dev)

CORS + rate limits

whether originals are stored for uploads or not

job queue behavior (BullMQ retries/DLQ/replay)

export formats and limits

admin boundaries (what lgu_admin can/can’t manage)

That’s exactly what you want before any code generation.

Small update to your PHASE 2 prompt (so it matches your finalized architecture)

Use this updated version (still “questions only”, but aligned with what we finalized):

Plain text
We are building using Spec-Driven Platform V6 STRICTEST.

1) Read:
- docs/PRODUCT.md
- docs/MODULE_REGISTRY.md
- docs/PERMISSION_REGISTRY.md
- docs/ENTITY_REGISTRY.md
- project.memory.md
- docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md
- docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md

2) Ask structured technical questions (QUESTIONS ONLY, do not generate files):
A) Platform identity & environments
- confirm workspace name shown in UI (Blue Ocean Governance Platform is OK?)
- confirm dev/stage/prod base domains
- confirm tenant subdomain format: {lgu}.fish.powerbyte.app and bluealliance.fish.powerbyte.app
- confirm local dev tenant routing approach (hosts file vs query param fallback vs localhost subpaths)

B) Tenancy & data isolation
- confirm tenancy is multi now (per LGU)
- confirm if any shared/global reference data exists besides barangays
- confirm whether barangays are global fixed list (Calapan-only for now) or tenant-configurable later

C) Auth & RBAC (Keycloak)
- confirm realm name
- confirm client IDs for web and api
- confirm issuer URL for dev/stage/prod
- confirm JWT claims mapping for:
  - userId
  - tenantId (where should it live? claim name)
  - roles claim name (realm_access.roles or resource_access?)
- confirm whether roles are global + tenant roles, or tenant roles only with global_admin exception

D) Module boundaries & menus
- confirm module routes prefix convention: /fms/*, /vms/*, /bluesentinel/*
- confirm if menus should be stored in DB (ModuleMenu) or generated from spec initially then stored

E) Uploads & optimization
- confirm allowed mime types and max sizes for images
- confirm whether to store originals (yes/no)
- confirm target sizes for thumb/display variants for photo and signature

F) Background jobs (BullMQ)
- confirm queues needed: media-optimization, exports, id-print
- confirm retries/backoff defaults
- confirm DLQ + replay requirement (yes)

G) Reporting & dashboards
- confirm LGU dashboard KPIs and charts priority list (top 10)
- confirm Blue Alliance global dashboard KPIs and drill-down expectations

H) Security & governance
- confirm audit log events required across modules
- confirm retention/export/right-to-delete policy targets
- confirm CORS allowed origins (dev/stage/prod)
- confirm rate limits for public/auth/upload endpoints
- confirm CSRF approach for Next.js + API

I) Infra defaults
- confirm docker compose services baseline (postgres, redis, keycloak, minio)
- confirm whether k8s scaffold is disabled by default

Only ask questions. Do not generate code or files.
After you run PHASE 2, what’s next

Once you answer those questions, you run PHASE 3 (Scaffolding / Implementation Map updates) in your process (whatever your V6 defines), and only then start generating:

Prisma schema from ENTITY_REGISTRY.md

NestJS modules + controllers

Next.js routes + pages

Module menus + permission guards

Upload optimization job + storage buckets

ID Printing job + template system

If you want to be extra safe: after PHASE 2 outputs questions, paste your answers back here and I’ll convert them into final updates to:

docs/PRODUCT.md

docs/PERMISSION_REGISTRY.md

docs/ENTITY_REGISTRY.md

docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md
