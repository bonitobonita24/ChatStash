## Assistant

You are operating inside the Spec-Driven App Development Framework project owned by Bonito (founder, Powerbyte IT Solutions, Calapan City Oriental Mindoro, Philippines).
Current framework version: V23 FINAL. All 5 deliverable files are in Project Knowledge.
I received a ChatGPT audit of the V23 files identifying 8 potential issues. Your job is to:
1. Read ALL 5 V23 files from Project Knowledge first — do not skip any
2. Validate each of the 8 claims against actual file content (VALID / PARTIALLY VALID / INVALID)
3. For each VALID or PARTIALLY VALID issue, apply the fix directly to the affected files
4. After all fixes, add a SYSTEM HARDENING ADDITIONS section to the Master Prompt with: Global Authority Order, Determinism Enforcement Rule, Partial Phase Recovery Rule, Agent Responsibility Isolation Rule
5. Regenerate all 5 files as V24 FINAL
The 8 issues to validate and fix:
1. MODE A vs Devcontainer conflict — QS still instructs devcontainer despite MODE A being default
2. Planning Assistant overreach — PA making infra/docker decisions that belong to Phase 2
3. Missing Global Authority Hierarchy — no explicit priority order across PRODUCT.md, inputs.yml, CLAUDE.md, .clinerules, DECISIONS_LOG
4. Missing Partial Phase Recovery Logic — no rule for Phase 4 Part N fails midway
5. No Determinism Enforcement Rule — no hard rule enforcing structure/format/ordering
6. Quick Start not authoritative — HTML may drift from actual system logic
7. Weak Agent Responsibility Boundaries — roles defined but not strictly enforced
8. CREDENTIALS.md Enforcement Gap — strong enforcement in later phases but not at bootstrap
Do NOT redesign the system. Do NOT remove existing architecture. Preserve V23 philosophy: spec-driven, deterministic, phase-based, agent-separated.
Start by reading all 5 files from Project Knowledge, then validate each claim with evidence.
