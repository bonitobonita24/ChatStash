## User

from my recent chat here in chatGPT, we had created a Phase-based Spec Driven AI Mega Prompt System wherein you will just define what your app would be by just filling the single source of truth, the inputs.yml. and from that file, it will build the app based on the technologies we just planned on how an app that i described will be built. I want you to analyze it and check it because our recent chat is taking too long to response maybe because of message had grown so much

## Assistant

Got you. The slow response is almost certainly because the “mega prompt” + phase outputs + scaffolding text has grown into a very large context window, so every new message forces the model to re-read (and re-attend to) a lot of tokens.

Even without re-opening the entire old thread, I can still “audit” the architecture of your Phase-based Spec-Driven AI Mega Prompt System and tell you exactly what to tighten so it stays fast, deterministic, and Copilot-friendly.

What usually makes these Mega Prompt Systems slow (and brittle)

The prompt contains the whole world every turn
Repeating: principles + phases + tech stack rules + folder structure + coding standards + security + deployment + migrations + queues… all in one message.

Phases don’t have strict output contracts
If Phase 2 outputs vary in format, Phase 3 has to “interpret” instead of “consume”.

Inputs.yml is “single source of truth” but not machine-validated
When fields are missing/ambiguous, the model fills gaps (hallucination risk).

No “diff mode”
Every change causes a full regen instead of minimal patch instructions.

Mixed concerns
App spec + architecture + coding style + CI/CD + security model + operational runbooks are all blended.

The fix: make it fast by making it modular + contract-driven
A) Split the Mega Prompt into 3 layers (so you don’t resend everything)

Layer 1: Core Engine (static, short)

Role + rules

Phase list

Hard constraints: “only use Inputs.yml + existing repo state”

Output contracts (schemas) per phase

Layer 2: Phase Runner (sent per phase only)

“Run Phase 2 only”

Includes only the Phase 2 contract + required context

References Inputs.yml as the SSOT

Layer 3: Repo State Snapshot (tiny, dynamic)

Only: file tree + key config files + last phase output hash

Never paste entire files unless necessary

Result: you stop paying token costs for repeating the whole spec every time.

B) Make every phase output a strict “artifact”

Each phase should emit:

artifact_id

inputs_hash (hash of inputs.yml)

phase_name

outputs in a fixed JSON/YAML structure

acceptance_checks[] (machine-checkable steps)

Example (conceptually):

Phase 1: spec.json (domain, features, roles, user stories, nonfunctional reqs)

Phase 2: architecture.json (services, modules, data flows, queues, outbox, S3 uploads)

Phase 3: tasks.yaml (ordered tasks, each with file targets)

Phase 4+: patches (actual code changes)

If Phase 3 always produces the same task schema, Phase 4 can execute without re-explaining.

C) Add a real schema for inputs.yml (preflight)

Your “SSOT” should be enforced by a validator:

YAML → JSON Schema

preflight checks:

required fields present

enums for stack choices (postgres/mysql, redis, auth strategy)

feature flags for: minio_presigned_upload, bullmq_outbox, pino_logging, db_migrations

This is the single biggest stability upgrade: the model stops guessing.

D) Introduce “diff-only mode”

Instead of regenerating the entire plan, add:

mode: generate | diff

In diff, the system must:

compute what changed in inputs

output only impacted artifacts/tasks

produce code patches only for touched areas

This keeps later turns small and fast.

E) Reduce “policy text” by moving it into short checklists

Security/scalability standards should not be 2000 lines of prose. Convert them into:

a checklist (10–25 items)

and a gate (“fail if missing”)

Example gates:

“API must use pino structured logging”

“Outbox processor via BullMQ + Redis”

“MinIO uses presigned upload pattern (no streaming through API)”

“Migrations scaffold exists and is wired to CI”

Concrete refactor plan for your system (drop-in)

If you want the system to stay portable across chat tools (incl. Copilot), structure it like this:

ENGINE.md (short, ~80–150 lines)
Rules + phase list + output contracts.

inputs.yml (your SSOT)
Your filled values only.

artifacts/

spec.json

architecture.json

tasks.yaml

decisions.md (only ADR-style decisions, short)

PHASE_RUNNER prompts (one per phase, very small)

run_phase_1.md

run_phase_2.md

etc.

Then in any new chat you paste only:

ENGINE.md (once)

inputs.yml

“Run Phase X”

That’s it.

Quick “health checklist” to see if your current system is the problem

If your current mega prompt does any of these, it’s why it’s slow:

Repeats the full tech stack + folder structure + best practices every message

Has phases but no strict output schema

Doesn’t store phase outputs as artifacts that later phases reference

Regenerates everything on minor changes

Mixes “planning prose” with “execution instructions” in the same phase

If you paste just 2 things, I can do a precise audit (without reloading the whole old chat)

You don’t need to paste the entire conversation. Paste only:

your current ENGINE / Mega Prompt text (even if long)

your current inputs.yml

Then I’ll:

point out exactly which sections are bloating context

rewrite it into the 3-layer modular system above

tighten phase contracts

add a schema + preflight rules

produce a Copilot-friendly “Run Phase X” prompt set

If you don’t want to paste everything, even the top half of the engine + the full inputs.yml is enough to diagnose the bottlenecks.

## User

ok, i think you missed understood what i meant of slow response, its the chatGPT conversation is the one that i am referring to be slow and not the mega prompt that ran in copilot chat. we have lots of conversations before we built perfectly this mega prompt to create an app so that's why is taking so long now and sometimes my browser hangs or to long to respond everytime i made a chat

## Assistant

Ahhh — got it now. You’re not talking about the Mega Prompt being slow.

You’re talking about this ChatGPT conversation thread itself becoming slow — browser lag, long response times, UI hanging — because the thread has grown massive.

Yes. That absolutely happens.

Let me explain clearly what’s going on.

Why This Chat Thread Is Slow

When a conversation becomes very long:

The browser is rendering thousands of messages

Every scroll = heavy DOM

Large code blocks = heavy memory usage

The UI becomes sluggish

Each new message increases context size

The system has to consider earlier conversation context

Even if not fully re-read, metadata still grows

Token accumulation increases processing time

Large code dumps slow rendering

Especially structured scaffolds, file trees, prompts, YAML

Syntax highlighting is expensive in browser

Workspace plans (Pro/Business) can amplify lag

Extra features (history sync, org controls) add overhead

Especially in long threads

This is not your system’s fault.
This is simply a very large conversation thread.

The Correct Solution

You should NOT continue in this thread.

You should:

1️⃣ Create a New Chat

Then paste only:

Your final Mega Prompt Engine

Your latest inputs.yml

Not the whole history.

How To Move Cleanly To A New Chat

Here’s the clean migration approach:

Step 1

Save this thread to your GitHub repo (which you already automated).

Step 2

Start a new chat.

Step 3

Paste:

Code
Context:
This is continuation of my Phase-Based Spec-Driven AI Mega Prompt System.

Here is the Engine:
[paste engine]

Here is inputs.yml:
[paste file]

We are currently at Phase X.

That’s it.

You do NOT need:

The discussions

The iterations

The refinement messages

The design arguments

The early broken versions

Just the final engine + inputs.yml.

Pro Tip (Important)

For large architecture systems like yours:

Never let a chat exceed ~200–300 messages.

Once it becomes stable:

Snapshot it

Start fresh

Continue clean

This keeps:

Browser fast

Responses faster

Context cleaner

Model more deterministic

Even Better (Professional Setup)

Since you're building serious architecture systems:

Create a permanent file in your repo:

Code
/ai-system/engine.md
/ai-system/inputs.yml
/ai-system/current_phase.md

Then in ChatGPT you only ever paste those 3 things.

This prevents history bloat forever.

Why ChatGPT Feels Slower Near the End of Long Threads

Because:

The UI holds all previous markdown in memory

Code blocks aren’t virtualized efficiently

Scroll position recalculation gets expensive

Syntax highlighting re-renders

It’s a frontend limitation, not an AI limitation.

You Did Nothing Wrong

In fact, long threads usually mean:

Deep system thinking

Complex iteration

Serious architecture design

You just hit the practical UI limit.

If you want, I can now:

Help you design a “Thread Reset Protocol”

Or give you a small template you paste at the top of every new chat to continue seamlessly

Or optimize your Mega Prompt to be ultra-minimal context

Your system itself sounds solid.

This is just a UI scaling issue.

## User

ok but can we start it here again?

## Assistant

Short answer: yes, we can continue here — but with a controlled reset approach.

The chat is slow because of accumulated UI + history weight, not because the system is broken. If we’re smart about what we include from now on, we can keep this thread usable.

How We Continue Here Without Making It Worse

We do a hard context reset inside this thread.

From this point forward:

❌ We do NOT reference earlier exploratory messages.

❌ We do NOT scroll back mentally to previous drafts.

❌ We do NOT paste massive historical logs.

✅ We treat this message as the new baseline.

Step 1 — Minimal Reboot

Reply with only:

Your final Engine prompt (current version)

Your current inputs.yml

What phase you are in

Nothing else.

Do not include:

Explanation

Old iterations

Why decisions were made

Discussion history

Just the artifacts.

Step 2 — I’ll Reconstruct the State Cleanly

I will:

Rebuild mental model from those files only

Audit structure

Suggest improvements if needed

Continue from current phase

This keeps:

Context lean

Responses fast

Browser lighter

No history dependency

Important

We should now operate in:

Artifact-driven mode
Not conversation-driven mode

Meaning:
We only talk through files and outputs, not long discussions.

If at any point it becomes slow again, I’ll help you migrate cleanly in under 2 messages.

So yes — we can continue here.

Send:
Engine
inputs.yml
Current Phase

And we restart clean from there.

Paste this:


We are building a new app using the Spec-Driven Platform.

Ask me structured questions to define:
- app name
- purpose
- user roles
- core entities
- modules needed

Add Prisma to apps/api.

Create:
- prisma/schema.prisma
- PrismaService
- migration scripts
- db scripts in package.json

Include:
- outbox_event table
- user table
- role table

Use DATABASE_URL env.


Run:


pnpm install
pnpm -C apps/api db:generate
pnpm -C apps/api db:migrate


---

# 🔵 PART 5 — INFRASTRUCTURE (HOST ONLY)

Paste:


Generate docker-compose.yml for host-run.

Services:
- postgres
- redis
- keycloak (admin/admin)
- minio (admin/admin)

Include:
- env example file
- realm import config


Then OUTSIDE devcontainer (host terminal):


docker compose up -d


---

# 🔵 PART 6 — STRUCTURED LOGGING

Paste:


Add structured logging using nestjs-pino.

Requirements:
- requestId
- JSON logs in prod
- pretty logs in dev
- userId if available


---

# 🔵 PART 7 — PRESIGNED S3 UPLOADS

Paste:


Add S3 presigned upload endpoint using AWS SDK v3.

- Retry + backoff
- Idempotency

Expose:
GET /outbox/health


---

# 🔵 PART 9 — FEATURE UPDATES (FOREVER)

Whenever editing inputs.yml:

Paste:


FEATURE UPDATE

I modified inputs.yml:

<describe change>

Modify only impacted modules.
Do not regenerate entire repo.
Keep hydration rules intact.


---

# 🔵 FINAL RESULT

You now have:

✔ Spec-driven architecture

✔ Strict hydration enforcement

✔ Prisma migrations

✔ Structured logging (Pino)

✔ Presigned S3 upload pattern

✔ BullMQ outbox processor

✔ Keycloak OIDC

✔ MinIO storage

✔ Redis

✔ Compose-first infra

✔ CI validation

✔ Devcontainer-safe

This is production-aligned.

Not a toy setup.

Not a pet project.

## Assistant

Yep — we can restart from exactly that baseline right here.

Also: your “last response” is already solid. I’ll do two things:

Lock it in as our new baseline (we won’t depend on anything earlier in the thread).

Patch a couple small gotchas that commonly break devcontainers / pnpm in GitHub Codespaces + VS Code.

✅ Baseline accepted (this is now the “start point”)

From this message onward, we assume your system is exactly what you pasted.

🔧 Tiny fixes I strongly recommend (to prevent common issues)
1) Fix workspaceFolder

This line is risky:

JSON
"workspaceFolder":"/workspaces/repo"

Because your repo folder name usually won’t be literally repo. Use the standard macro:

JSON
"workspaceFolder": "/workspaces/${localWorkspaceFolderBasename}"

So your .devcontainer/devcontainer.json becomes:

JSON
{
  "name": "Spec-Driven App Platform",
  "build": { "dockerfile": "Dockerfile" },
  "workspaceFolder": "/workspaces/${localWorkspaceFolderBasename}"
}

This avoids the exact “No package.json found in /workspace” class of problems you hit before.

2) Add one quality-of-life setting (optional but helps performance)

In huge repos, VS Code inside container can be heavy. Add this (safe, small):

JSON
"customizations": {
  "vscode": {
    "settings": {
      "files.watcherExclude": {
        "**/node_modules/**": true,
        "**/.turbo/**": true,
        "**/.next/**": true,
        "**/dist/**": true
      }
    }
  }
}

Still minimal, but cuts UI lag.

🚦Now: where do you want to restart from?

Pick one, and I’ll continue immediately:

Option A — You haven’t defined the app yet

We do PART 2 (the structured questions).

Option B — You already defined the app in a previous chat/tool

You paste your current filled inputs.yml and I’ll:

sanity check it

improve it for your stack (NestJS + Next + Keycloak + MinIO + Prisma + BullMQ)

generate inputs.schema.json rules (conditionals included)

Option C — You already generated the monorepo scaffold

You paste the repo tree (just tree -L 3 output) and I’ll:

verify structure

tell you the next exact phase prompt to run

catch missing pieces (pino, prisma scripts, compose-first rules, etc.)

Fastest path (no extra back-and-forth)

If you want the quickest restart right now, do this:

Tell me which option (A/B/C).

If B, paste your current inputs.yml (even if incomplete).

If C, paste tree -L 3 + your root package.json scripts section.

And we continue cleanly from there.

## User

ok but before that, can you tell where should I add this statement?

"customizations": {
  "vscode": {
    "settings": {
      "files.watcherExclude": {
        "**/node_modules/**": true,
        "**/.turbo/**": true,
        "**/.next/**": true,
        "**/dist/**": true
      }
    }
  }
}

## Assistant

Good question 👍

You add that inside:

Code
.devcontainer/devcontainer.json

It must be a top-level property in the JSON file (same level as "name" and "build").

✅ Final Correct .devcontainer/devcontainer.json

Here’s exactly how your file should look after adding it:

JSON
{
  "name": "Spec-Driven App Platform",
  "build": {
    "dockerfile": "Dockerfile"
  },
  "workspaceFolder": "/workspaces/${localWorkspaceFolderBasename}",

  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "settings": {
        "files.watcherExclude": {
          "**/node_modules/**": true,
          "**/.turbo/**": true,
          "**/.next/**": true,
          "**/dist/**": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Why this helps

Inside a monorepo with:

pnpm

turbo

Next.js

Prisma

NestJS

VS Code file watchers can become heavy.

This prevents VS Code inside the container from constantly watching:

node_modules

.turbo cache

.next builds

dist builds

Result:

Less CPU usage

Less memory usage

Smoother typing

Fewer UI freezes

Important

After editing:

Code
Ctrl + Shift + P
Dev Containers: Rebuild Container

Not just reopen — rebuild.

If you want, I can also give you 2–3 more small devcontainer optimizations that keep this stack extremely stable long-term.

## User

yes sure please do

## Assistant

Here are a few small, safe devcontainer optimizations that help a lot with stability + speed for your pnpm/turbo/Next/Nest/Prisma stack—without adding “features” or docker-compose-in-container.

1) Persist pnpm store (big speed-up on reinstall)

Add this to .devcontainer/devcontainer.json (top-level):

JSON
"mounts": [
  "source=pnpm-store,target=/home/node/.pnpm-store,type=volume"
]

Then set pnpm to use it by adding to .devcontainer/Dockerfile:

dockerfile
ENV PNPM_STORE_PATH=/home/node/.pnpm-store
RUN pnpm config set store-dir ${PNPM_STORE_PATH}

Why: pnpm install becomes dramatically faster across rebuilds.

2) Don’t let VS Code index huge folders

You already added watcher excludes. Add search excludes too:

JSON
"customizations": {
  "vscode": {
    "settings": {
      "files.watcherExclude": {
        "**/node_modules/**": true,
        "**/.turbo/**": true,
        "**/.next/**": true,
        "**/dist/**": true
      },
      "search.exclude": {
        "**/node_modules/**": true,
        "**/.turbo/**": true,
        "**/.next/**": true,
        "**/dist/**": true
      }
    }
  }
}

Why: global search won’t melt your container on large repos.

3) Use a consistent user + better git safety

Add these top-level keys in devcontainer.json:

JSON
"remoteUser": "node",
"updateRemoteUserUID": true

Why:

avoids root-owned files

prevents permission weirdness with pnpm, prisma, and git

4) Add a post-create hook to “prime” the repo (optional)

If you always want the container ready after build:

JSON
"postCreateCommand": "corepack enable && pnpm -v"

Or if you want it to auto-install (only if you prefer):

JSON
"postCreateCommand": "corepack enable && pnpm install"

Why: fewer “it works on my machine” moments.

5) Increase file descriptor limit for Node-heavy dev (Linux containers)

In .devcontainer/devcontainer.json, add:

JSON
"runArgs": ["--ulimit", "nofile=65536:65536"]

Why: Next.js + turbo + watchers can hit limits on some setups.

Recommended “minimal but strong” devcontainer.json (combined)

If you want one clean version, here’s a good default that stays within your rules:

JSON
{
  "name": "Spec-Driven App Platform",
  "build": { "dockerfile": "Dockerfile" },
  "workspaceFolder": "/workspaces/${localWorkspaceFolderBasename}",

  "remoteUser": "node",
  "updateRemoteUserUID": true,

  "mounts": [
    "source=pnpm-store,target=/home/node/.pnpm-store,type=volume"
  ],

  "runArgs": ["--ulimit", "nofile=65536:65536"],

  "postCreateCommand": "corepack enable && pnpm -v",

  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "settings": {
        "files.watcherExclude": {
          "**/node_modules/**": true,
          "**/.turbo/**": true,
          "**/.next/**": true,
          "**/dist/**": true
        },
        "search.exclude": {
          "**/node_modules/**": true,
          "**/.turbo/**": true,
          "**/.next/**": true,
          "**/dist/**": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

And add to .devcontainer/Dockerfile:

dockerfile
ENV PNPM_STORE_PATH=/home/node/.pnpm-store
RUN pnpm config set store-dir ${PNPM_STORE_PATH}

If you tell me whether you’re using Codespaces or local Docker Desktop, I can also recommend the best memory/CPU settings and a couple VS Code settings that reduce hangs even more (still lightweight).

## User

ok but before that, can you provide a complete copy paste context of this suggestions you made? because i really dont understand on what line should I add those code snippets so i think maybe its better that you make a complete context per file so that I will just override everything inside that file

## Assistant

Perfect 👍 that’s actually the safest approach — full file overrides.

Below are the complete final versions of both files.
You can safely replace everything inside them.

✅ 1️⃣ .devcontainer/devcontainer.json (FULL FILE)

Replace the entire file with this:

JSON
{
  "name": "Spec-Driven App Platform",

  "build": {
    "dockerfile": "Dockerfile"
  },

  "workspaceFolder": "/workspaces/${localWorkspaceFolderBasename}",

  "remoteUser": "node",
  "updateRemoteUserUID": true,

  "mounts": [
    "source=pnpm-store,target=/home/node/.pnpm-store,type=volume"
  ],

  "runArgs": ["--ulimit", "nofile=65536:65536"],

  "postCreateCommand": "corepack enable && pnpm -v",

  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "settings": {
        "files.watcherExclude": {
          "**/node_modules/**": true,
          "**/.turbo/**": true,
          "**/.next/**": true,
          "**/dist/**": true
        },
        "search.exclude": {
          "**/node_modules/**": true,
          "**/.turbo/**": true,
          "**/.next/**": true,
          "**/dist/**": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
✅ 2️⃣ .devcontainer/Dockerfile (FULL FILE)

Replace the entire file with this:

dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:20

ENV PNPM_HOME="/usr/local/share/pnpm"
ENV PATH="$PNPM_HOME:$PATH"

# Enable pnpm
RUN corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@9.12.0 --activate

# Persist pnpm store for faster installs
ENV PNPM_STORE_PATH=/home/node/.pnpm-store
RUN pnpm config set store-dir ${PNPM_STORE_PATH}

# Basic tools only (no compose plugin inside container)
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y git curl ca-certificates netcat-traditional && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
✅ After Replacing Both Files

Very important:

Code
Ctrl + Shift + P
Dev Containers: Rebuild Container

Not just reopen. Rebuild.

What You Just Improved

✔ pnpm installs persist between rebuilds
✔ Fewer VS Code freezes
✔ Less CPU usage
✔ No root permission issues
✔ Higher file descriptor limit for Next.js/Turbo
✔ Cleaner workspace path handling

Still:

No docker compose inside container

Host-run infra only

Minimal configuration

Production-aligned

If you tell me whether you're using:

Local Docker Desktop

I can tune memory/CPU allocation next for maximum smoothness.

## User

i'm using Local Docker Desktop

## Assistant

Nice — Local Docker Desktop gives you the most control. Here are the best, low-effort tweaks to reduce hangs and speed everything up, without changing your platform rules.

1) Give Docker Desktop enough resources (most important)

In Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources:

Memory: 8–12 GB (minimum 6 GB)

CPUs: 4–8

Swap: 2–4 GB (or leave default if you have lots of RAM)

Disk image size: 60–100 GB (monorepos + node_modules grow fast)

Why: Next.js + turbo + Nest + Prisma + Keycloak (host) can spike RAM/CPU.

2) Put your repo on a “fast path”

This matters a lot depending on OS:

If you’re on Windows + WSL2

Clone the repo inside WSL (e.g. ~/projects/your-repo)

Open VS Code from WSL (code .)

Do not work from /mnt/c/... (it’s slower)

If you’re on macOS

Keep the repo on the internal SSD

Avoid external drives for devcontainers

Why: devcontainers are extremely sensitive to filesystem latency.

3) Reduce Next.js / turbo watcher pressure

Add these environment variables (safe defaults) for local dev.

Option A (recommended): add .env at repo root

Create ./.env:

Bash
WATCHPACK_POLLING=true
CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true
CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL=500

Why: On some machines, file events between host ↔ container can glitch; polling stabilizes it (slightly more CPU, but fewer “stuck” watchers).

If your machine is strong and things already work well, you can skip this.

4) Add an “easy reset” cleanup script (helps when Docker gets messy)

Add this to your root package.json scripts later (when it exists):

JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev:clean": "rm -rf node_modules .turbo apps/web/.next apps/web/node_modules apps/api/node_modules packages/shared/node_modules"
  }
}

Then when stuff is weird:

Bash
pnpm dev:clean
pnpm install
5) Docker Desktop file sharing optimization (macOS/Windows)

In Docker Desktop settings:

Ensure the drive/folder where your repo lives is allowed in File Sharing

Prefer VirtioFS (macOS, if available) for better performance

Why: slow shared mounts = slow installs + slow builds.

6) VS Code extensions: avoid container bloat

Inside the container, keep extensions minimal. The main ones you want:

ESLint

Prettier

Prisma

Docker (optional)

Avoid: heavy “All-in-one” extension packs inside the container.

Quick “If still slow” checklist

If it’s still sluggish after these:

Close other heavy apps (Chrome tabs, Android Studio, etc.)

Rebuild the container

Remove old volumes occasionally:

Docker Desktop → Volumes → remove unused pnpm-store volumes if you want to reset cache

If you tell me your OS (Windows/macOS/Linux) + RAM amount, I can recommend the exact sweet-spot resource numbers and whether polling watchers is worth it.

## User

im using Docker using WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04. im also running my vscode inside WSL2

## Assistant

Perfect setup. WSL2 + VS Code in WSL is the fastest path on Windows. Here are the best WSL2-specific tweaks that usually eliminate hangs and make devcontainers + pnpm/turbo feel snappy.

1) Make sure the repo lives in the WSL filesystem (critical)

✅ Good:

/home/<you>/projects/my-repo

❌ Avoid:

/mnt/c/... (Windows filesystem mount)

This one change alone often fixes “random slowness”.

2) Give WSL enough RAM/CPU via .wslconfig

On Windows, create/edit:

C:\Users\<YourWindowsUser>\.wslconfig

Paste this (safe defaults for modern machines):

INI
[wsl2]
memory=10GB
processors=6
swap=4GB
localhostForwarding=true

Then apply it:

Close VS Code

In Windows PowerShell (not WSL), run:

PowerShell
wsl --shutdown

Reopen WSL + VS Code

Notes:

If you have 16GB RAM, use memory=8GB.

If you have 32GB RAM, memory=12GB–16GB is great.

3) Docker Desktop settings for WSL2 integration

In Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → WSL Integration:

Enable integration for Ubuntu-24.04

Make sure it’s checked

Also in General:

Ensure “Use WSL 2 based engine” is enabled

4) Fix “watchers + hot reload” issues the right way

WSL2 usually works great, but when file events get flaky across containers, do this:

Add a root .env (only if you notice missed reloads)

Create ./.env in the repo root:

Bash
WATCHPACK_POLLING=true
CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true
CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL=300

If everything already reloads perfectly, skip it.

5) Prevent VS Code from indexing build junk

You already added watcher/search excludes in devcontainer.json (good).

Also add a .gitignore early (when you scaffold) so turbo/next/prisma outputs don’t clutter.

Minimum .gitignore:

gitignore
node_modules
dist
.next
.turbo
.env
.env.*
6) Keep Docker storage in the Linux filesystem (helps performance)

Most WSL2 setups already do this, but double check:

Your Docker Desktop WSL engine should store images/volumes inside its WSL distro (fast)

Avoid storing project volumes on Windows drive mounts

7) Quick diagnostics when it feels “stuck”

Run these inside WSL:

Check WSL memory pressure
Bash
free -h
Check disk speed location
Bash
df -h .

If you see you’re in /mnt/c, move the repo.

Check Docker isn’t choking
Bash
docker stats

If vmmem is pegged in Windows Task Manager, .wslconfig tuning is the fix.

My recommended “sweet spot” (if you tell me your specs)

Reply with:

RAM (e.g. 16GB / 32GB)

CPU cores (e.g. 8 / 12)

…and I’ll give you the exact best .wslconfig values.

If you don’t want to share specs, the config I gave (10GB, 6 cores) is a solid general-purpose baseline for devcontainers + Next + Nest + Postgres/Redis/Keycloak on host.

## User

here are my laptop specs:
CPU: Intel core i7-13620H
Memory: 47GB DDR5
Storage: 512GB NVME
Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 6GB Dedicated

## Assistant

Nice—those specs are plenty. With 47GB RAM and a 13620H, you can make WSL2 + Docker Desktop feel very close to native.

Best .wslconfig for your machine (balanced + fast)

Create/edit this file in Windows:

C:\Users\<YourWindowsUser>\.wslconfig

Paste:

INI
[wsl2]
memory=24GB
processors=10
swap=8GB
localhostForwarding=true
Why these numbers

24GB RAM gives Node/turbo/Next + containers plenty of headroom without starving Windows.

10 processors (you likely have 10 physical cores: 6P + 4E; 16 threads total) is a good cap so Windows stays responsive.

8GB swap prevents hard stalls during spikes (big installs/builds).

Apply it

In Windows PowerShell:

PowerShell
wsl --shutdown

Then reopen Ubuntu + VS Code.

Docker Desktop settings (WSL2)

In Docker Desktop → Settings:

Resources

With WSL2 engine, Docker uses the WSL VM, so the .wslconfig is the real limiter.

Still, keep “Resources” reasonable if shown.

WSL Integration

Enable integration for Ubuntu-24.04

General

✅ Use the WSL 2 based engine

Storage tip (your 512GB NVMe)

Monorepos + Docker images + volumes will fill 512GB quicker than expected.

Do these habits:

Periodically prune unused stuff:

Bash
docker system prune -af
docker volume prune -f

(Only when you’re sure you don’t need old images/volumes.)

Keep your repo inside WSL, e.g.:

Bash
~/projects/your-repo
Watcher stability (only if you see hot-reload weirdness)

If Next.js reloads are inconsistent inside container, add a root .env:

Bash
WATCHPACK_POLLING=true
CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true
CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL=300

If everything is already stable, skip this (polling uses more CPU).

VS Code: one more setting that reduces lag

Since you’re inside WSL2, sometimes VS Code Git scanning can be heavy in monorepos.

In VS Code settings (User or Remote), consider:

Git: Auto Repository Detection → openEditors (optional)

Or disable GitLens heavy features if installed

Not required, just a common win.

Quick sanity check after you apply .wslconfig

Inside WSL, run:

Bash
nproc
free -h

You should see ~10 CPUs available and ~24GB memory.

If you want, paste the output of these two commands after the restart:

Bash
nproc && free -h

…and I’ll tell you if WSL actually picked up the limits correctly.

## User

# 🔵 PART 2 — DEFINE THE APP FEATURES

Inside Devcontainer.

Open Copilot Chat.

Paste this:


We are building a new app using the Spec-Driven Platform.

Ask me structured questions to define:
- app name
- purpose
- user roles
- core entities
- modules needed
- offline capability
- realtime capability
- data sensitivity
- tenancy model

Do NOT generate files yet.
Only ask questions.


Answer the questions.

When done:

based strictly on my answers and project.memory.md.

Include:
- modules section
- capabilities (offline/realtime)
- background_jobs config
- storage config
- auth config
- governance flags
- strict JSON schema with conditionals

Output only:
- inputs.yml
- inputs.schema.json


Copy them into your repo.

---

# 🔵 PART 3 — GENERATE THE PLATFORM

Now paste this into Copilot:


Generate full monorepo scaffold based on inputs.yml and project.memory.md.

Requirements:

ROOT:
- package.json (workspace scripts)

- Health endpoint

packages/shared:
- shared types

Do not install compose plugin.
Do not require compose inside devcontainer.


---

# STEP 4 — Install Dependencies

Run inside devcontainer:


pnpm install
pnpm build


If this fails → fix errors before proceeding.

---

# 🔵 PART 4 — DATABASE + MIGRATIONS (PRISMA)

Paste:


Add Prisma to apps/api.

Create:
- prisma/schema.prisma
- PrismaService
- migration scripts
- db scripts in package.json

Include:
- outbox_event table
- user table
- role table

Use DATABASE_URL env.


Run:


pnpm install
pnpm -C apps/api db:generate
pnpm -C apps/api db:migrate


---

# 🔵 PART 5 — INFRASTRUCTURE (HOST ONLY)

Paste:


Generate docker-compose.yml for host-run.

Services:
- postgres
- redis
- keycloak (admin/admin)
- minio (admin/admin)

Include:
- env example file
- realm import config


Then OUTSIDE devcontainer (host terminal):


docker compose up -d


---

# 🔵 PART 6 — STRUCTURED LOGGING

Paste:


Add structured logging using nestjs-pino.

Requirements:
- requestId
- JSON logs in prod
- pretty logs in dev
- userId if available


---

# 🔵 PART 7 — PRESIGNED S3 UPLOADS

Paste:


Add S3 presigned upload endpoint using AWS SDK v3.

POST /uploads/presign
Return:
- uploadUrl
- objectKey

Use MinIO config from env.
Validate file type + size.


---

# 🔵 PART 8 — BACKGROUND JOBS (BULLMQ)

Paste:


Add BullMQ background processing.

Implement:
- Redis connection
- Queue
- Worker
- OutboxProcessor
- Retry + backoff
- Idempotency

Expose:
GET /outbox/health


---

# 🔵 PART 9 — FEATURE UPDATES (FOREVER)

Whenever editing inputs.yml:

Paste:


FEATURE UPDATE

I modified inputs.yml:

<describe change>

Modify only impacted modules.
Do not regenerate entire repo.
Keep hydration rules intact.


---

# 🔵 FINAL RESULT

You now have:

✔ Spec-driven architecture

✔ Strict hydration enforcement

✔ Prisma migrations

✔ Structured logging (Pino)

✔ Presigned S3 upload pattern

✔ BullMQ outbox processor

✔ Keycloak OIDC

✔ MinIO storage

✔ Redis

✔ Compose-first infra

✔ CI validation

✔ Devcontainer-safe

This is production-aligned.

Not a toy setup.

Not a pet project.

## Assistant

Here’s a straight, “production engineer” review of that playbook. Overall it’s strong and very usable. The main gaps are: security hardening details, environment/config discipline, compose wiring, and a couple Nest/Next gotchas that will bite later. Below are the exact improvements I’d make while keeping your rules (spec-driven, compose-first host-run, devcontainer-safe, no compose-in-container).

What’s already solid

Clean “from zero” flow: manual files → devcontainer → define app → generate scaffold → add infra → add features.

Correct separation: infra runs on host; app runs in devcontainer.

Right stack: pnpm + turbo, Next App Router, Nest, Prisma, Keycloak, MinIO, BullMQ.

Hydration discipline noted (server-only layout/page; client components only as needed).

Structured logging + background jobs + presigned uploads included explicitly.

Issues / missing steps that will cause friction
1) Your inputs.yml starts as {} but you don’t enforce validation early

You mention tools/validate-inputs.mjs, but there’s no step that says:

“run validation before generating”

“CI fails if inputs.yml invalid”

“schema is actually used”

Fix: In Part 3, require:

pnpm validate:inputs script

pre-commit or CI step that runs it

generator refuses to proceed if invalid

Copilot prompt addition (Part 3) — add:

“Root scripts must include validate:inputs that runs tools/validate-inputs.mjs against inputs.yml using inputs.schema.json”

“CI must run pnpm validate:inputs before build/test”

2) Compose-first infra needs explicit networking + ports + healthchecks

Right now Part 5 says “Generate docker-compose.yml” but doesn’t force:

named network (so services discoverable consistently)

healthchecks (Postgres/Redis/Keycloak/MinIO)

stable ports

volumes

Keycloak realm import mount path

MinIO console port + bucket bootstrap (optional)

Fix: Add these requirements to the Part 5 prompt:

Healthchecks for postgres/redis/keycloak/minio

Named volumes for persistence

Network platform

Explicit ports (e.g., postgres 5432, redis 6379, keycloak 8080, minio 9000/9001)

depends_on with health conditions (where supported)

Keycloak import: mount realm JSON + --import-realm

3) You’re missing the .env.example + env loading rules for all apps

You say “No environment hardcoding”, but you don’t force:

.env.example at root

.env never committed (you added to gitignore good)

Next reads client-safe env via NEXT_PUBLIC_*

API uses config module + validation

Fix: Add a phase/step after Part 5:

PART 5.5 — CONFIG DISCIPLINE

Root .env.example

apps/api uses @nestjs/config + zod/joi validation + fails fast

apps/web has env.ts (or similar) that validates required env at boot

“No process.env.X scattered; only via config layer”

This is a big production-grade difference.

4) Security section is mentioned, but not actually specified

You list “includes security” in expectations, but the steps don’t include concrete security controls. Production-grade needs at least:

Helmet

CORS rules

Rate limiting (you mention it, but not config)

ValidationPipe (you mention it)

Auth guard scaffolding with Keycloak (JWT validation / OIDC)

RBAC enforcement (roles/permissions model)

Audit logging (optional)

Secrets handling (never log tokens)

Upload validation (you mention file type/size—good)

Fix: Add a dedicated part:

PART 6.5 — SECURITY BASELINE (API)
Copilot prompt should require:

helmet enabled

strict CORS allowlist from env

@nestjs/throttler configured per route group

global validation pipe with whitelist + forbidNonWhitelisted

request size limits

auth guard scaffold (JWT verification with JWKS / Keycloak)

RBAC decorator + guard (roles)

security headers + no stack traces in prod

This avoids “security is implied” problems.

5) Prisma migrations: you need a repeatable local workflow + CI behavior

Your Prisma step is okay, but production alignment usually means:

prisma migrate dev for local

prisma migrate deploy for prod/CI

seed script (optional)

DATABASE_URL is used, but you also need SHADOW_DATABASE_URL sometimes (depending on workflow)

Fix: In Part 4 prompt, require scripts:

db:generate

db:migrate:dev

db:migrate:deploy

db:studio (optional)

db:seed (optional)

Also: outbox table should have indexes + idempotency key.

6) BullMQ outbox: needs transaction pattern + polling strategy

You requested “OutboxProcessor, idempotency, retry/backoff” — good. Missing details:

How events get inserted (same DB transaction as business write)

Worker concurrency + lock duration

Exactly-once-ish behavior (idempotency key + unique constraint)

Poison message handling / dead letter strategy

Fix: Add to Part 8 prompt:

Outbox table columns: id, aggregateType, aggregateId, eventType, payload, status, attempts, nextRunAt, lockedAt, lockedBy, idempotencyKey, timestamps

Unique index on idempotencyKey

Processor claims rows with SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED (or Prisma equivalent strategy)

Worker updates status + increments attempts

Move to FAILED after max attempts

/outbox/health returns queue + DB lag metrics

7) Presigned uploads: you need a “complete pattern”

Presign endpoint is good, but a production pattern also needs:

objectKey naming scheme (tenant/user/date)

content-type restrictions + content-length restrictions (MinIO supports some; S3 policies differ)

optional POST policy vs PUT presign

callback/confirm endpoint or event record (so you know upload completed)

public/private bucket policy rules

Fix: Extend Part 7 prompt with:

deterministic objectKey format

allowlist MIME types

max size

“confirm upload” endpoint: client calls back with objectKey; API records metadata + creates outbox event

8) Web app hydration rules need enforcement method

You mention tools/hydration-lint.mjs, but you don’t define what it checks. If this is a core rule, enforce it:

block use client in layout.tsx and page.tsx

require .client.tsx naming for client components

optional ESLint rule or custom script

Fix: In Part 3 prompt, explicitly define:

what hydration-lint checks

CI runs it

9) Missing “how to run dev”

The playbook says build, but you don’t give the dev commands:

pnpm dev (turbo)

which ports to visit (web, api)

how to verify Keycloak login works

Fix: Add a Part after scaffolding:

PART 3.5 — RUN

pnpm dev starts web + api

apps/api on http://localhost:3001 (or whatever)

apps/web on http://localhost:3000

health checks

login flow notes

Minimal patch to your playbook (keep everything, just insert these parts)

If you only want the smallest edits while keeping your structure:

Part 3: add enforce validate:inputs + hydration-lint in CI

After Part 5: add Part 5.5 Config Discipline

After Part 6: add Part 6.5 Security Baseline

Part 4: strengthen Prisma scripts + migrate deploy

Part 7: add confirm endpoint + objectKey convention

Part 8: add proper outbox schema + locking/idempotency

Add Part 3.5: run instructions

That makes it truly “no missing steps” and “production-grade” rather than “good scaffold”.

The biggest single improvement

If you do only one upgrade: Config Discipline + Validation (Part 5.5 + CI validation).
That’s what keeps spec-driven platforms from turning into “random env drift”.

If you want, I can rewrite your playbook into a v2 that includes all these inserts while staying copy/paste-friendly (same style, same phases, still Copilot driven).

## User

- in my vscode + WSL2 Ubuntu, i have Cline, SpecStory, Continue, Prisma, Thunder Client & TODOs extensions. 
- i want to setup my own AI Code Agent but i want everything to be as free as possible and everything is open source. i can manage small amount fees if that's really necessary
- i'm not that very code savvy but i just want to built an app based on spec driven prompt
- suggest the best setup for my laptop that has a specification of:
CPU: Intel core i7-13620H 
Memory: 47GB DDR5 
Storage: 512GB NVME 
Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 6GB Dedicated

## Assistant

Perfect. With your machine, you can build a serious local AI coding agent setup without depending heavily on paid APIs.

You have:

i7-13620H (very solid)

47GB RAM (excellent)

RTX 4050 6GB (usable for 7B–14B models)

WSL2 Ubuntu

Docker

VS Code inside WSL

You’re in a very strong position.

Let me give you a realistic, production-minded, mostly-open-source setup tailored to:

Spec-driven development

Not extremely code savvy

Want agent behavior

Want low or near-zero recurring cost

🎯 Goal

You want:

“My own AI Code Agent that reads spec, edits repo, scaffolds app, and works locally.”

Without heavy OpenAI bills.

🔵 High-Level Architecture (Recommended)

You will use:

🧠 Local Model (Primary Brain)

Ollama

Model: qwen2.5-coder:7b OR deepseek-coder:6.7b

Runs locally on RTX 4050

🤖 VS Code Agent Layer

Continue (open source)

Or Cline (good for agent-style)

Connected to Ollama

☁ Optional Smart Assist (Small Paid Backup)

Cheap OpenAI API key (for very complex reasoning only)

Use sparingly

🔵 Why This Is The Best Setup For You
Option	Cost	Power	Control	Fit for You
Full OpenAI GPT-4	$$$	🔥🔥🔥	Low	Overkill
Claude API	$$	🔥🔥🔥	Low	Not needed daily
Self-host 30B model	Free	Heavy GPU need	High	RTX 4050 too small
Ollama + 7B model	Free	🔥🔥	High	✅ Perfect
Ollama + 14B	Free	🔥🔥🔥	Medium	Borderline on 6GB VRAM

For your GPU (6GB VRAM):

7B models = smooth

14B = possible with quantization but slower

30B+ = not practical

🔵 Step-by-Step: Your Ideal Setup
1️⃣ Install Ollama in WSL2 (Linux side)

Inside Ubuntu:

Bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

Then pull a model:

Bash
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b

Alternative:

Bash
ollama pull deepseek-coder:6.7b

I recommend:

qwen2.5-coder:7b for structured generation.

Test it:

Bash
ollama run qwen2.5-coder:7b
2️⃣ Connect Continue Extension to Ollama

In VS Code:

Continue → Settings → Models

Add:

JSON
{
  "models": [
    {
      "title": "Local Qwen Coder",
      "provider": "ollama",
      "model": "qwen2.5-coder:7b"
    }
  ]
}

Now your AI runs locally.

No API cost.

3️⃣ Best Agent Mode Setup

For spec-driven architecture:

Use Continue for:

Scaffold generation

Refactoring

Code patching

Reading repo context

Use Cline when:

You want tool-execution behavior

It modifies files automatically

Runs shell commands

Cline is closer to “agent.”

🔵 How You Should Use It (Since You're Not Very Code Savvy)

Do NOT freestyle prompt.

Instead, create:

Code
/ai/
  engine.md
  rules.md
  inputs.yml

Then instruct your agent:

Code
You are an AI Code Agent.

Rules:
- inputs.yml is SSOT
- Modify only impacted modules
- Never regenerate entire repo
- Follow project.memory.md

Local models perform MUCH better when given structure.

🔵 What About SpecStory?

SpecStory is good for:

Tracking requirements evolution

Writing structured product specs

But it is not a strong code agent.

Keep it for documentation, not generation.

🔵 What About Prisma + Thunder Client?

Perfect.

Your setup is actually very clean:

Prisma extension → DB safety

Thunder Client → API testing

Continue/Cline → Code agent

Docker host infra

Devcontainer for isolation

This is a very modern dev setup.

🔵 Performance Expectations On Your Machine

With qwen2.5-coder 7B:

15–35 tokens/sec

Feels interactive

Good at Nest + Next + Prisma

Handles scaffolding well

Struggles with extremely complex reasoning

For complex reasoning:

Occasionally use OpenAI GPT-4o mini (cheap)

Or DeepSeek API (cheap)

🔵 If You Want MAX POWER (Hybrid Setup)

Use:

Local Ollama 7B for:

File edits

Refactors

Code fixes

Routine generation

Cheap API model for:

Architecture design

Complex multi-phase reasoning

You’d spend maybe:

$5–$15/month

Instead of $100+.

🔵 Advanced (Optional): GPU Acceleration Check

Inside WSL:

Bash
nvidia-smi

If visible → Ollama will use GPU.

If not:
You need to enable CUDA in WSL2 (I can guide you).

🔵 What I Recommend For YOU Specifically

Given:

Not very code savvy

Want spec-driven generation

Want mostly free

Want agent-like automation

Your Best Stack:

Ollama (local)

qwen2.5-coder:7b

Continue extension

Cline for command execution

Rare OpenAI GPT-4o-mini fallback

This gives you:

Autonomy

Low cost

Control

Good performance

Stability inside WSL2

🔵 Final Question For You

Do you want:

A) Pure local-only setup (100% free, some limitations)
B) Hybrid setup (local + small API backup for hard tasks)
C) More advanced “true autonomous agent” architecture (LangGraph, AutoGen, etc.)

Tell me which direction and I’ll design the exact implementation architecture for your machine.
