# STEP 3 — Open Devcontainer

Press:


Ctrl + Shift + P
Dev Containers: Reopen in Container


Wait until container finishes building.

…if there’s an update, always run rebuild container


docker
Ctrl + Shift + P
Dev Containers: Rebuild Container


---

# 🔵 PART 2 — DEFINE THE APP FEATURES

Inside Devcontainer.

Open Copilot Chat.

Paste this:


We are building a new app using the Spec-Driven Platform.

Ask me structured questions to define:
- app name
- purpose
- user roles
- core entities
- modules needed
- offline capability
- realtime capability
- data sensitivity
- tenancy model

Do NOT generate files yet.
Only ask questions.


Answer the questions.

When done:

Paste this:


Generate production-grade inputs.yml and inputs.schema.json
based strictly on my answers and project.memory.md.

Include:
- modules section
- capabilities (offline/realtime)
- background_jobs config
- storage config
- auth config
- governance flags
- strict JSON schema with conditionals

Output only:

Do not install compose plugin.
Do not require compose inside devcontainer.


---

# STEP 4 — Install Dependencies

Run inside devcontainer:


pnpm install
pnpm build


If this fails → fix errors before proceeding.

---

# 🔵 PART 4 — DATABASE + MIGRATIONS (PRISMA)

Paste:


Add Prisma to apps/api.

Create:
- prisma/schema.prisma

Not a pet project.

## Assistant

Below is a “senior DevOps + senior web app architecture” review of your Mega AI Spec-Driven App Architecture and Development Prompt, with concrete gaps, future-proofing suggestions, and specific prompt upgrades you can paste back into your playbook.

What you already nailed (and why it matters)

Compose-first, host-run (keeps devcontainer clean, avoids Docker-in-Docker footguns)

Spec-driven inputs.yml + schema (enables automation, validation, safer refactors)

Devcontainer-safe (reproducible dev env, predictable Node/pnpm)

Prisma + outbox + BullMQ (correct direction for reliability)

MinIO + presigned uploads (good separation of data plane vs control plane)

Hydration rules for Next App Router (this is a common “slow death” problem if not enforced)

That said: for “production-grade”, you’re missing several pillars that will bite later.

Gaps / missing pillars (most important)
1) Observability is only “logs” right now

Logging ≠ observability. You want the trifecta: logs + metrics + traces.

Missing:

OpenTelemetry tracing across web → API → jobs

Metrics (Prometheus format) with RED/USE indicators (request rate, errors, latency; queue depth, job failures)

Correlation propagation (requestId should follow into BullMQ jobs and DB outbox processing)

Dashboards/alerts scaffolding (even “local only” via Grafana is huge)

Add to prompt:

/metrics endpoint (Nest)

OTEL SDK wiring + trace context in BullMQ (jobId, correlationId)

2) Secrets/config governance is underspecified

You say “No environment hardcoding” but you don’t define how envs are managed.

Missing:

A config module pattern in Nest (validation + typed config)

Env validation at boot (fail fast)

Secret handling for CI + deployment (even scaffold-level)

Separate .env.example per app vs root

Add:

apps/api/src/config using @nestjs/config + zod/envalid

tools/check-env.mjs that verifies required env vars per inputs.yml

3) Auth is referenced but not integrated end-to-end

You list Keycloak but don’t specify the “full chain”:

Missing:

Next.js login flow (OIDC) approach:

next-auth (Auth.js) with Keycloak provider, or

custom OIDC PKCE flow

API token validation (JWT) and role mapping conventions

Service-to-service auth (jobs/cron/internal calls)

Multi-tenant identity strategy (realm-per-tenant vs tenant claim)

Add:

A clear authorization contract:

roles/permissions model

where RBAC is enforced (guards in Nest; UI gating in web)

claim mapping from Keycloak → your roles table

4) Reliability patterns: you have outbox + jobs, but not the rest

Good start with outbox. But production reliability also needs:

Missing:

Transactional boundaries defined (when outbox row is inserted)

DLQ strategy (dead-letter queue) + admin tooling

Job concurrency limits, rate limits, and poison-message handling

Idempotency keys and dedupe rules formalized (DB uniqueness constraints, not just code)

Backpressure signals (queue depth thresholds)

Add:

BullMQ dashboard (even if dev-only)

“DLQ queue + replay endpoint (admin-only)”

Unique constraints for idempotency in Prisma schema

5) Security hardening is present only as “rate limiting + logging”

Missing basics you’ll regret later:

Helmet (Nest) and hardened headers

CORS policy defined by environment (dev vs prod)

CSRF strategy (depends on cookie vs bearer usage)

Input validation everywhere (you mention ValidationPipe, but also need DTO conventions + whitelist/forbidNonWhitelisted)

Dependency scanning + SAST + secret scanning in CI

Audit logging for sensitive actions

Object storage security (bucket policies, lifecycle, PII handling)

Add to CI:

pnpm audit (with allowlist policy)

CodeQL (GitHub) or Semgrep

Secret scanning (GitHub default + pre-commit hooks optional)

6) API contract & versioning is missing

Production-grade APIs usually need:

Missing:

OpenAPI/Swagger generation + versioning strategy

Request/response envelope conventions

Error model standardization

Pagination/sorting/filtering standard

Add:

/api/v1/...

Swagger at /docs in non-prod

Global exception filter returning { code, message, requestId, details }

7) Data lifecycle + backups + migrations operational plan is missing

You have migrations but not the ops around them.

Missing:

Migration execution strategy in CI/CD (when, where, rollback posture)

Backup/restore workflow (even local scaffold)

Retention policy / GDPR delete pattern if you ever store PII

DB connection pooling (PgBouncer consideration later)

Add:

docker-compose optional service: pgbackrest/simple backup script

“migrate on deploy” step in pipeline scaffold (with guardrails)

Developer experience gaps (these affect speed and correctness)
1) Testing strategy isn’t defined

Missing:

Unit + integration tests (Nest)

Playwright/Cypress for web

Contract tests (API schema)

Test containers (optional) for DB/Redis during CI

Add:

pnpm test root script

apps/api integration tests using ephemeral Postgres (or compose in CI)

2) Linting/formatting/type-safety guardrails incomplete

You have hydration lint, but not:

ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript strict baseline

Commit hooks (optional)

Conventional commits + changelog (optional)

3) Monorepo boundaries + shared package versioning

Missing:

Path alias conventions across packages

Avoiding circular deps

Build graph enforcement in Turborepo

Compose-first infra gaps (dev/prod parity)

Your compose is “dev infra”, but production-grade needs:

Compose profiles (dev, observability, ci)

Reverse proxy/TLS termination (Caddy/Traefik/Nginx) even as scaffold

Healthchecks on all services + dependency ordering

Resource limits (cpu/mem) to catch runaway behavior early

Named networks and least-privileged exposure (don’t publish everything)

Also Keycloak realm import: good, but include:

client settings (redirect URIs for web)

roles/realm roles mapping

test users

Spec-driven gaps: what should be in inputs.yml but isn’t yet

You currently generate modules/capabilities, but “future you” will want these sections:

Recommended additions to inputs.yml

environments: dev/stage/prod overrides (no hardcoded env)

observability: otel, metrics, log level, exporters

security: cors, csrf mode, cookie settings, helmet on/off

tenancy: single|multi, tenantClaim, data partition strategy

api: versioning, pagination defaults, rate limits per route group

jobs: queues, concurrency, retry policy, DLQ enabled, dashboard

storage: bucket policies, lifecycle, max object size, allowed MIME

data: pii fields, retention, deletion workflows

ci: test matrix, scanning toggles, required checks

deploy: docker images, ports, ingress assumptions, k8s scaffold toggle

This is the difference between “spec-driven scaffolding” and “spec-driven platform”.

Concrete edits you should make to your prompt (copy/paste blocks)
A) Add a new Part: “Non-negotiable production baselines”

Paste after “PART 3 — GENERATE THE PLATFORM”:

Code
BASELINES (must be generated, not optional):
- OpenAPI docs + API versioning (/api/v1)
- Global exception filter with stable error shape (includes requestId)
- @nestjs/config with schema validation and typed config
- Metrics endpoint (/metrics) + health endpoints (liveness/readiness)
- OpenTelemetry tracing scaffold (http + prisma + bullmq correlation)
- Helmet + CORS policy per environment
- ESLint + Prettier + TS strict
- Unit/integration test scaffold (api) + e2e scaffold (web)
- CI includes lint + test + typecheck + build + dependency scan
B) Upgrade “Generate docker-compose.yml” requirements

Replace your Part 5 paste with:

Code
Generate docker-compose.yml for host-run with PROFILES.

Services (profile=dev):
- postgres (healthcheck, volume)
- redis (healthcheck)
- keycloak (healthcheck, realm import)
- minio (healthcheck, console)
- createbuckets/init job for MinIO

Services (profile=observability):
- grafana
- prometheus
- loki (optional)
- tempo/jaeger (optional)

Include:
- docker-compose.override.yml example
- env.example (root + per-app)
- network segmentation (only expose necessary ports)
- resource limits
C) Add a “Policy: correlation everywhere”

Add this to logging section:

Code
Logging + tracing policy:
- requestId generated at edge (API) and propagated everywhere
- include requestId in Prisma query logs and BullMQ job data
- job logs must include jobId, queueName, correlationId
Smaller but real issues in your current playbook

.gitignore is too minimal for teams:

add .DS_Store, *.log, coverage, .idea, .vscode/* (selectively), *.tsbuildinfo

postCreateCommand only prints pnpm version; consider also:

pnpm install optionally (but only if you want automatic installs)

You don’t define Node/pnpm version enforcement at repo-level:

add .nvmrc or packageManager + engines in root package.json

“K8s-ready scaffold only” is mentioned but not implemented:

add /deploy/k8s with Helm/Kustomize skeleton and clear “not production-ready yet” notes

Highest-value “future features” you’ll want eventually

If this platform aims to be long-lived, plan now for:

Feature flags (simple config-driven to start)

Multi-tenant support (tenant isolation rules early)

Webhooks module (outbox-driven delivery, retry, signing secret)

Audit trail (append-only events for sensitive actions)

Rate limiting by identity (not just IP)

Data export/import endpoints (admin-only)

File malware scanning workflow (async job) if you accept uploads from users

API client SDK generation from OpenAPI (typesafe front-end calls)

If you want a “tightened” version of your prompt (what I’d do)

Your current prompt is good as a procedural playbook, but it should also include a platform contract:

“These are the invariant rules (security/observability/config/test).”

“These are spec-driven knobs (inputs.yml).”

“These are generated artifacts (monorepo + infra + CI).”

“These are the operational runbooks (migrations, backups, incident basics).”

If you want, I can rewrite your entire prompt into a single cohesive v2 that:

keeps your tone (“No confusion. No missing steps.”),

adds the missing baselines above,

and upgrades inputs.yml/schema into a real platform contract.

Just say “rewrite to v2” and I’ll output the full improved prompt in one go.

## User

rewrite to v2

## Assistant

Perfect.

This is not a toy scaffold.

This is a controlled platform.

If you'd like, I can now:

🔬 Do a “DevOps SRE Hardening v3” version

🧠 Turn this into a reusable internal platform template

🏗 Convert this into a true multi-tenant SaaS blueprint

☸ Add a real Kubernetes production track

Tell me which direction you want next.

## User

- Do a “DevOps SRE Hardening v3” version
- Add the version 1 copy-paste files just like what you mentioned in .devcontainer/devcontainer.json and .devcontainer/Dockerfile files  so that I wont forget it if I lost a copy of version 1 
- state clearly how will I execute the scripts if it is for copilot chat, create a file or whatever how should it be handled
- maintain docker compose as default app host setup for development, staging and production level.  - Add a real Kubernetes production track only to make preparations for kubernetes and later if needed I will just make an update in inputs.yml file or whatever file should be edit for that to trigger kubernetes setup in the future
- Turn this into a reusable internal platform template
- Add option in the inputs.yml if I wanted multi-tenant SaaS setup earlier before setting the app or for later if I wanted it upgraded to multi-tenant

## Assistant

Got it. Below is your DevOps / SRE Hardening V3 playbook, including:

✅ Full V1 copy-paste devcontainer files (so you never lose them)

✅ Clear rules: what goes into Copilot Chat vs files vs terminal

✅ Docker Compose remains the default for dev / staging / prod

✅ Kubernetes track = scaffold only, toggled later via inputs.yml

✅ Designed as a reusable internal platform template

✅ Multi-tenant SaaS option (choose now or upgrade later), spec-driven

🔵 SPEC-DRIVEN PLATFORM — V3 (DEVOPS + SRE HARDENING)

This is V3: production hygiene, SRE controls, platform template structure.

No missing steps. No “later we’ll add it”.
Everything is scaffolded now, even if disabled by spec.

RULES: HOW YOU EXECUTE THINGS (VERY CLEAR)
1) Copilot Chat prompts

Use Copilot Chat for:

Generating code/files

Applying controlled diffs

Creating new modules

Refactoring impacted areas only

How:

You paste a prompt into Copilot Chat.

Copilot prints file contents.

You paste into your repo (or let Copilot apply changes if you use “apply”).

2) Manual file creation

Only do manual creation for:

Bootstrapping files listed in PART 1

inputs.yml + schema

Platform template meta files (README, docs, etc.)

Everything else is generated.

3) Terminal commands

Terminal is ONLY for:

pnpm install/build/test

docker compose ...

prisma migrate commands

scripts under /tools

Important:

Devcontainer terminal runs pnpm, node, turbo

Host terminal runs docker compose

🔵 PART 0 — PLATFORM TEMPLATE MODE (REUSABLE INTERNAL TEMPLATE)

This repo is not “an app”. It’s a platform template that generates apps.

Required structure (generated scaffold must follow this):
Code
/apps
  /web
  /api
/packages
  /shared
/tools
/docs
/platform
  /templates
  /policies
  /runbooks
/deploy
  /compose
    /dev
    /stage
    /prod
  /k8s-scaffold   (disabled until enabled in spec)

Why: you can reuse this for multiple internal apps without rewriting.

🔵 PART 1 — ABSOLUTE ZERO (BOOTSTRAP FILES)
STEP 1 — Create Repo

Create new GitHub repo (template-ready).
Clone locally. Open VS Code.

STEP 2 — Create ONLY THESE FILES MANUALLY
.gitignore
gitignore
node_modules
dist
.next
.turbo
.env
.env.*

  "private": true,
  "packageManager": "pnpm@9.12.0",
  "engines": { "node": ">=20" }

✅ V1 DEVCONTAINER FILES (COPY-PASTE SAFE ARCHIVE)

Create folder:

Code

Important:

NO devcontainer features

NO compose plugin

NO docker inside container

Compose is host-run only

project.memory.md (V3 baseline)
Markdown
# Project Memory (V3)

## Platform Rules
- inputs.yml is Single Source of Truth
- Spec-driven generation only
- Compose-first (host-run)
- No Docker-in-Docker
- Typed config + fail-fast env validation
- CI gates: lint, typecheck, test, build, scans
- Observability baseline: logs + metrics + traces
- Security baseline: headers, CORS, strict validation, audit logging
- Multi-tenant ready by spec (enable now or later)

## Hydration Rules
- layout.tsx and page.tsx are server-only
- interactive code only in *.client.tsx
- no server imports in client components
- hydration lint enforced

## SRE Baselines
- SLO mindset: health/readiness, metrics, alerts scaffolding
- Correlation IDs everywhere (HTTP -> DB -> Queue)
- DLQ + replay support
- Backups + restore runbooks
🔵 PART 2 — SPEC CONTRACT (inputs.yml V3 + schema)
inputs.yml V3 template (you will generate final values later)

Create inputs.yml manually:

YAML

  k8s:
    scaffold_enabled: true
    enabled: false # KEEP FALSE until you choose later
    mode: "kustomize" # kustomize | helm
inputs.schema.json

Generate this via Copilot (do not hand-write).
It must include strict conditionals:

if tenancy.mode = multi → require tenant_claim + partitioning

if deploy.k8s.enabled = true → require cluster params

if observability.tracing.enabled → enforce exporter fields

🔵 PART 3 — SPEC DISCOVERY (Copilot Chat)

Paste into Copilot Chat:

Plain text
We are building an app on Spec-Driven Platform v3 (DevOps + SRE hardened).

Ask structured questions to finalize inputs.yml values:

- app identity and owners
- tenancy (single now vs multi now; and upgrade plan)
- auth (Keycloak roles/claims)
- data sensitivity (PII)
- storage types and size limits
- background jobs and replay requirements
- staging/prod base_url
- observability exporters (OTLP/Jaeger)
- SLO targets (availability/latency) for scaffolded alerts
- deploy strategy: keep compose default; k8s scaffold disabled but prepared

Do NOT generate any files yet.
Only ask questions.

After answering, paste:

Plain text
Generate:
- finalized inputs.yml
- inputs.schema.json (strict JSON schema, with conditionals)
Output only YAML and JSON.
🔵 PART 4 — GENERATE PLATFORM TEMPLATE (Copilot Chat)

Paste this into Copilot Chat:

Plain text
Generate the full monorepo scaffold as an INTERNAL PLATFORM TEMPLATE.

Strict rules:
- Use inputs.yml as source of truth.
- Compose-first always for dev/stage/prod.
- K8s is scaffold-only until deploy.k8s.enabled=true.
- Multi-tenant capability must be scaffolded even if tenancy.mode=single.

Create structure:

/apps/web (Next.js App Router + shadcn/ui)
/apps/api (NestJS)
/packages/shared
/tools
/docs
/platform/templates
/platform/policies
/platform/runbooks
/deploy/compose/{dev,stage,prod}
/deploy/k8s-scaffold (generated but inactive)

ROOT files:
- pnpm-workspace.yaml, turbo.json, tsconfig.base.json
- eslint/prettier configs + strict TS
- tools/validate-inputs.mjs (validate against inputs.schema.json)
- tools/check-env.mjs (fail-fast)
- tools/hydration-lint.mjs
- .github/workflows/ci.yml (quality gates + scan placeholder)
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/RUNBOOKS.md
- docs/SECURITY.md
- docs/OBSERVABILITY.md

API requirements:
- @nestjs/config + zod/env validation
- ValidationPipe: whitelist + forbidNonWhitelisted + transform
- Global exception filter with error envelope {code,message,requestId,details}
- Versioning: /api/v1
- Swagger /docs disabled in prod by spec
- Health: /health/liveness and /health/readiness
- Metrics: /metrics Prometheus
- Logging: nestjs-pino with requestId and userId
- Tracing: OpenTelemetry scaffold (HTTP + Prisma + BullMQ correlation)
- Security: Helmet + CORS by spec
- Auth: Keycloak JWT validation + RBAC guards
- Tenancy: tenant context extraction (claim) + middleware/guard scaffold
- Prisma: user/role + outbox_event + audit_log tables
- Jobs: BullMQ queues, DLQ, replay endpoint admin-only, idempotency keys

Web requirements:
- OIDC login (Keycloak) scaffold
- Role-based UI gating
- Hydration-safe boundaries enforced
- Error boundary + notFound handling
- API client typed via shared package (no direct fetch spaghetti)

Compose requirements:
- /deploy/compose/dev/docker-compose.yml (dev services)
- /deploy/compose/stage/docker-compose.yml (stage parity)
- /deploy/compose/prod/docker-compose.yml (prod-grade compose)
- include healthchecks, networks, volumes, minimal exposed ports
- include observability profile services (prom/grafana/loki optional)

Do NOT require docker inside devcontainer.
Do not install docker compose plugin.
🔵 PART 5 — INSTALL + VALIDATE (Devcontainer terminal)

Inside devcontainer:

Bash
pnpm install
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm tools:validate-inputs
pnpm tools:check-env

If anything fails, fix immediately.

🔵 PART 6 — HOST INFRA (Docker Compose default for ALL envs)
Dev (host terminal)
Bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/dev/docker-compose.yml up -d
Stage
Bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/stage/docker-compose.yml up -d
Prod (compose-based production)
Bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/prod/docker-compose.yml up -d

Rule: Compose stays primary until you explicitly switch.

🔵 PART 7 — KUBERNETES TRACK (SCAFFOLD ONLY)

You will always generate:

Code
/deploy/k8s-scaffold
  /base
  /overlays/dev
  /overlays/stage
  /overlays/prod

But it does nothing unless:

YAML
deploy:
  k8s:
    enabled: true

When enabled later:

generator creates kustomize or helm

includes manifests for api/web/redis/postgres external assumptions

uses sealed-secrets/external-secrets placeholders

includes HPA + ingress scaffold

includes observability annotations

No k8s deployment occurs until you enable it.

🔵 MULTI-TENANT SAAS OPTION (ENABLE NOW OR LATER)

To enable multi-tenant now:

YAML
tenancy:
  mode: "multi"
  partitioning: "schema"
  tenant_claim: "tenant_id"

To upgrade later:

you update tenancy.mode from single → multi

run pnpm tools:validate-inputs

run pnpm platform:apply (generated script) to apply only impacted changes:

tenancy middleware/guards

Prisma schema changes (tenant_id, constraints)

migration generation

Keycloak realm roles/claims updates

UI tenant switcher scaffold

🔵 SRE HARDENING (WHAT V3 ADDS)
Operational Runbooks (docs/runbooks)

Backups + restore

DB migration procedure

Incident playbook (high error rate, queue stuck, storage outage)

Key rotation notes

DR assumptions

Reliability Controls

DLQ + replay

Idempotency enforced by DB unique constraints

Readiness checks depend on DB/Redis reachability

Metrics for queue depth / job failures / API latency

CI Gates

lint, typecheck, test, build

dependency audit

secret scanning hooks optional

code scanning optional

🔵 WHAT YOU GET (V3)

✔ reusable internal platform template repo
✔ compose dev/stage/prod structure
✔ SRE hardening baseline (metrics/traces/alerts scaffold)
✔ strict security governance
✔ multi-tenant option now or later
✔ k8s scaffold ready, toggled by spec
✔ spec-driven regeneration safely (impacted modules only)

Optional: Add “Platform Apply” Script (recommended)

In V3 scaffolding, include a command like:

pnpm platform:apply
which:

validates inputs.yml

diffs what changed

applies only impacted modules

runs formatting + tests

If you want, I can write the exact spec for how that diff/apply should work (module graph + change detector rules) so Copilot generates it correctly.

Tell me if you want:

diff-by-path only, or

diff-by-schema semantic (better, but more work).

## User

ok now, when and where should I tell what about the app? how it works and what will it does?
because i cant see where should I write the features of the app

## Assistant

Excellent question.

Right now, you built a platform generator, not an app.

So the confusion is natural:

“Where do I actually describe what my app does?”

Here is the clean mental model 👇

🧠 THE 3-LAYER MODEL (V3 PLATFORM)

You now have three distinct layers:

Layer	Purpose	Where You Write
1️⃣ Platform Template	Rules, DevOps, SRE, security	project.memory.md (fixed)
2️⃣ App Specification	What this specific app does	inputs.yml
3️⃣ Implementation Code	Generated from spec	/apps/*
✅ WHERE YOU DEFINE THE APP

You define the app in two places only:

1️⃣ Business Definition (Human-Readable)

Location:

Code
docs/PRODUCT.md

You create this manually.

This is where you describe:

What the app does

Target users

Business logic

Workflows

Core entities

User journeys

Constraints

Revenue model (if SaaS)

Regulatory concerns (if any)

This file is NOT code.
This is your business truth document.

2️⃣ Technical Spec (Machine-Readable)

Location:

Code
inputs.yml

This is what drives generation.

It contains:

Roles

Modules

Entities

Tenancy

Jobs

Security

Observability

Deployment strategy

This is your technical contract.

🔵 WHEN DO YOU WRITE FEATURES?

Right after bootstrapping.

Step order becomes:

Bootstrap repo

Create platform template

Create docs/PRODUCT.md

Then run spec discovery via Copilot

Then generate inputs.yml

Then generate scaffold

🔥 EXACT FLOW (NO CONFUSION)
STEP A — Write PRODUCT.md (manually)

Create:

Code
docs/PRODUCT.md

Example template:

Markdown
# Product Definition

## App Name
TaskFlow Pro

## Purpose
A task management SaaS for distributed teams.

## Target Users
- Admin
- Team Manager
- Member

## Core Entities
- Organization
- Project
- Task
- Comment
- Attachment

## Core Workflows
1. User registers
2. Creates organization
3. Invites members
4. Creates project
5. Assigns tasks
6. Tracks completion

## Realtime Requirements
- Task status updates

## Background Jobs
- Email notifications
- Weekly reports

## Data Sensitivity
- Email addresses
- Attachments

## Tenancy
Multi-tenant SaaS (organization-based isolation)

This is your business clarity anchor.

STEP B — Feed That Into Copilot

Now go to Copilot Chat and paste:

Plain text
We are building an app using Spec-Driven Platform v3.

Here is the product definition:

<paste PRODUCT.md content>

Based on this:

1) Ask structured questions to clarify missing technical details.
2) Do NOT generate files yet.

After answering questions:

Plain text
Generate:

- inputs.yml (fully filled)
- inputs.schema.json

Use the product definition as source of truth.
🧩 Why PRODUCT.md Matters

Without it:

You end up with technical scaffolding but no domain clarity

Features drift

inputs.yml becomes abstract

Multi-tenant decisions become accidental

With it:

Copilot understands domain context

Spec stays aligned with product

Regeneration stays consistent

Future devs understand intent

🔵 WHERE FEATURES LIVE LONG TERM
Type of Feature	Where It Lives
Business intent	docs/PRODUCT.md
Technical toggles	inputs.yml
Generated modules	/apps/*
Operational policies	/platform/policies
Incident handling	/docs/RUNBOOKS.md
🧠 IMPORTANT: inputs.yml Should NOT Describe Business Narrative

inputs.yml should contain:

Entities

Modules

Capabilities

Security settings

Deployment modes

Tenancy mode

It should NOT contain paragraphs of explanation.

That belongs in PRODUCT.md.

🔥 OPTIONAL (Highly Recommended)

Add this rule to project.memory.md:

Code
App feature definition must exist in docs/PRODUCT.md.
inputs.yml must reflect PRODUCT.md.
If PRODUCT.md changes, inputs.yml must be regenerated or updated.
🚀 Clean Summary

You write:

docs/PRODUCT.md → What the app is

inputs.yml → How the platform implements it

Copilot generates code → Based on spec

That’s the separation.

If you want, I can now:

🔄 Create a strict PRODUCT.md template optimized for AI generation

🧠 Show how to safely evolve features over time

📈 Show how to upgrade single-tenant → multi-tenant without rewriting the app

🏢 Show how to turn this into a multi-app internal platform factory

What direction do you want next?
